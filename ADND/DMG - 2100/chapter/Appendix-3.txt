== Potions ==
Potions are typically found in ceramic, crystal, glass, or metal flasks or vials (though you can change this, if you want), Flasks or other containers generally contain enough fluid to provide one person with one complete dose to achieve the effects described for each potion below.

Opening and drinking a potion has an initiative modifier of 1, but the potion doesn’t take effect until an additional initiative modifier delay of 1d4+1 has passed. Only then do the full magical properties of the potion become evident. Magical oils are poured over the body and smeared appropriately; this imposes a speed factor delay of 1d4 +1.

Potions can be compounded by mages at relatively low cost, However, they must have a sample of the desired potion to obtain the right formula. Furthermore, ingredients tend to be rare or hard to come by. This aspect of potions, as well as the formulation of mew ones by players, is detailed in the Spell Research rules (pages 43-44).

=== Identifying Potions ===
As a general rule, potion containers should bear no identifying marks, so player characters must sample from each container to determine the nature of the liquid inside. However, even a small taste should suffice to identify a potion in some way. Introduce different sorts of potions, both helpful and harmful, to cause difficulties in identification. In addition, the same type of potion, when created in different labs, might smell, taste, and look differently.

=== Combining Potions ===
The magical mixtures and compounds that make up potions are not always compatible. The compatibility of potions is tested whenever two potions are actually intermingled, or a potion is consumed by a creature while another such liquid, already consumed, is in effect.

Permanent potions have an effective duration of one turn for mixing purposes. If you drink another potion within one turn of drinking one with Permanent duration, check on Table 111. The exact effects of combining potions can’t be calculated, because of differences in formulae, fabrication methods, and component quality employed by various mages. Therefore, it is suggested that Table 111 be used, with the following exceptions:
# A delusion potion will mix with anything.
# A treasure finding potion will always yield a lethal poison.

Secretly roll 1d100 for potion compatibility, giving no clues until necessary. The effects of combining specific potions can be pre-set as a plot device, at your option.

	| Explosion. If two or more potions are swallowed together, internal damage is 6d10 hit points. Anyone within a 5‘ radius takes 1d10 points of damage. If the potions are mixed externally (in a beaker, say), all within 10’ radius suffer 4d6 points of damage, no saving throw.

&#42; A ''treasure finding'' potion always creates a lethal poison when combined with another potion.<br/>
&#42;&#42; A ''delusion'' potion can be mixed with all other potions.

=== Potion Duration ===
Unless otherwise stated, the effects of a potion last for four complete turns plus d4 additional turns (4 + d4).

=== List of Potions ===
'''Animal Control:''' This potion enables the imbiber to empathize with and control the emotions of animals of one type—cats, dogs, horses, etc. The number of animals controlled depends upon size: 5d4 animals of the size of giant rats; 3d4 animals of about man-size; or 1d4 animals weighing about ½ ton or more. The type of animal that can be controlled depends upon the particular potion, as indicated by die roll (d20):
{| class="wikitable"
	! D20 Roll

	|-
	| 1-4
	| mammal/marsupial
	|-

	| all of the above
|}
Animals with Intelligence of 5 (low Intelligence) or better are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. Control is limited to emotions or drives unless some form of communication is possible. Note that many monsters can’t be controlled by the use of this potion, nor can humans, demihumans, or humanoids (see ''ring of mammal control'').

'''Clairaudience:''' This potion empowers the creature drinking it to hear as the 3rd-level wizard spell of the same name. However, the potion can be used to hear even unknown areas within 30 yards. Its effects last for two turns.

'''Clairvoyance:''' This potion empowers the individual to see as the 3rd-level wizard spell, ''clairvoyance''. It differs from the spell in that unknown areas up to 30 yards distant can be seen. Its effects last for one turn.

'''Climbing:''' Imbibing this potion enables the individual to climb as a thief, up or down vertical surfaces. A ''climbing potion'' is effective for one turn plus 5d4 rounds.

The base chance of slipping and falling is 1%. Make a percentile check at the halfway point of the climb—01 means the character falls. For every 100 pounds carried by the character, add 1% to the chance of slipping. If the climber wears armor, add the following to the falling chance:
{| class="wikitable"

|}

'''Delusion:''' This potion affects the mind of the character so that he believes the liquid is some other potion (''healing'', for example, is a good choice—damage is “restored” by drinking it, and only death or rest after an adventure will reveal that the potion only caused the imbiber to believe that he was aided). If several individuals taste this potion, it is 90% probable that they will all agree it is the same potion (or whatever type the DM announces or hints at).

'''Diminution:''' After drinking this potion, the individual (and everything he’s carrying and wearing) diminishes in size—to as small as 5% of normal size. The percentage of the potion drunk determines the amount a character shrinks: For example, if 40% of the contents is swallowed, the person shrinks to 60% of normal size. The effects of this potion last for six turns plus 1d4 +1 turns.

'''Dragon Control:''' This potion enables the individual drinking it to cast what is, in effect, a ''charm monster'' spell upon a particular dragon within 60 yards. The dragon is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell, but with a —2 penalty. Control lasts for from 5-20 (Sd4) rounds. There are various sorts of dragon potions, as shown below:

'''Elixir of Health:''' This potion cures blindness, deafness, disease, feeblemindedness, insanity, infection, infestation, poisoning, and rot. It will not heal wounds or restore hit points lost through any of the above causes. Imbibing the whole potion will cure all of the above afflictions suffered by the imbiber. Half a flask will cure any one of two of the listed ills (DM’s choice).

'''Elixir of Madness:''' A single sip of this elixir causes the imbiber to go mad, as if affected by the 4th-level wizard spell, ''confusion'', until a ''heal'', ''restoration'', or ''wish'' spell is used to remove the madness. Once any creature is affected by the elixir, the remaining draught loses all magical properties, becoming merely a foul-tasting liquid.

'''Elixir of Youth:''' Quaffing this rare and potent elixir will reverse aging. Taking the full potion at once reduces the imbiber’s age by 1d4+1 years. Taking just a sip first, instead of drinking it down, will reduce the potency of the liquid, and drinking the lower-potency liquid reduces age by only 1d3 years.

'''ESP:''' The ''ESP'' potion bestows an ability that is the same as the 2nd-level wizard spell of the same name, except that its effects last for 5d8 rounds, i.e., 5 to 40 minutes.

'''Extra-Healing:''' This potion restores 3d8 +3 hit points of damage when wholly consumed, or 1d8 hit points of damage for each one-third that is drunk.

'''Fire Breath:''' This potion allows the imbiber to spew a tongue of flame any time within one hour of quaffing the liquid. Each potion contains enough liquid for four small draughts. One draught allows the imbiber to breathe a cone of fire 10’ wide and up to 20’ long that inflicts 1410 +2 points of damage (d10 +2), A double draught doubles the range and damage. A triple draught trebles the range and damage.If the entire potion is taken at once, the cone is 20’ wide, up to 80’ long, and inflicts 5d10 points of damage. Saving throws vs. breath weapon for half damage apply in all cases. If the flame is not expelled before the hour expires, the potion fails, with a 10% chance that the flames erupt in the imbiber’s system, inflicting double damage upon him, with no saving throw allowed.

'''Fire Resistance:''' This potion bestows upon the person drinking it magical invulnerability to all forms of normal fire (such as bonfires, burning oil, or even huge pyres of flaming wood), It also gives resistance to fires generated by molten lava, a ''wall of fire'', a ''fireball'', tiery dragon breath, and similar intense flame/heat. All damage from such fires is reduced by -2 from each die of damage, and if a saving throw is applicable, it is rolled with a+4 bonus. If one-half of the potion is consumed, it confers invulnerability to normal fires and half the benefits noted above (-1, +2). The potion lasts one turn, or five rounds for half doses.

'''Flying:''' A flying potion enables the individual drinking it to fly in the same manner as the 3rd-level wizard spell, ''fly''.

'''Gaseous Form:''' By imbibing this magical liquid, the individual causes his body, as well as anything he’s carrying or wearing, to become gaseous. The gaseous form is able to flow at a base speed of 3/round. (A ''gust of wind'' spell, or even normal strong air currents, will blow the gaseous form at air speed.)

The gaseous form is transparent and insubstantial. It wavers and shifts, and can’t be harmed except by magical fire or lightning, which do normal damage. A whirlwind inflicts double damage upon a creature in gaseous form. When in such condition the individual is able to enter any space that is not airtight—even a small crack or hole that allows air to penetrate also allows entry by a creature in gaseous form. The entire potion must be consumed to achieve this result, and the effects last the entire duration (4 + 1d4 turns).

'''Giant Control:''' A full potion of this draught must be consumed for its effects to be felt. It will influence one or two giants like a ''charm monster'' spell. Control lasts for 5d6é rounds. If only one giant is influenced, it is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell with a —4 penalty; if two are influenced, the die rolls gain a +2 bonus—you’re weakening the effect of the potion. The type of giant subject to a particular potion is randomly determined,
{| class="wikitable"

	|-
	| 18-19
	| Cloud Giant
	|-
	| 20
	| Storm Giant
|}

'''Giant Strength:''' This potion can be used only by warriors. When a giant strength potion is consumed, the individual gains great strength and bonuses to damage when he scores a hit with any hand-held or thrown weapon. It is also possible for the person to hurl rocks as shown on the table below, Note that the type of giant strength gained by drinking the potion is randomly determined on the same table:

'''Growth:''' This potion causes the height and weight of the person consuming it to increase. Garments and other worn and carried gear also grow in size. Each fourth of the liquid consumed causes 6’ height growth—in other words, a full potion increases height by 24’. Weight increases should be proportional to the change in height. Strength is increased sufficiently to allow bearing armor and weapons commensurate with the increased size, but does not provide combat bonuses. Movement increases to that of a giant of approximately equal size.

'''Healing:''' An entire potion must be consumed in a single round. If this is done, the potion restores 2d4 +2 hit points of damage (see ''extra-healing'' above).

'''Heroism:''' This gives the imbiber a temporary increase in levels (hit points, combat ability, and saves) if he has fewer than 10 levels of experience.

|}
When the potion is quaffed, the individual fights as if he were at the experience level bestowed by the magic of the elixir. Damage sustained is taken first from magically gained hit dice and bonus points. This potion can only be used by warriors.

'''Human Control:''' A ''potion of human control'' allows the imbiber to control up to 32 levels or Hit Dice of humans, humanoids, and demihumans as if a ''charm person'' spell had been cast. All creatures are entitled to saving throws vs. spell. Any pluses on Hit Dice are rounded down to the lowest whole die (e.g., 142 = 1,2+6 = 2, etc,), This potion lasts for 5d6 rounds. The type of human(s) that can be controlled is randomly determined.

|}

'''Invisibility:''' This potion confers invisibility similar to the 2nd-level wizard spell of the same name, Actions involving combat cause termination of the invisible state. The individual possessing this potion can quaff a single gulp—equal to ⅓ of the contents of the container—to bestow invisibility for 3-6 turns.

'''Invulnerability:''' This potion confers immunity to nonmagical weapons. It also protects against attacks from creatures (not characters) with no magical properties or with fewer than 4 Hit Dice. Thus, an 8th-level character without a magical weapon could not harm the imbiber of an invulnerability potion.

The potion also improves Armor Class rating by 2 classes and gives a bonus of +2 to the individual on his saving throws versus all forms of attack. Its effects are realized only when the entire potion is consumed, and they last for 5d4 rounds. Only warriors can use this potion.

'''Levitation:''' A ''levitation'' potion enables the consumer to levitate in much the same manner as the 2nd-level wizard spell of the same name. The potion allows levitation of the individual only, to a maximum weight of 600 pounds. The consumer can carry another person, as long as their total weight is within this limit.

'''Longevity:''' The ''longevity'' potion reduces the character’s age by 1d12 years, restoring youth and vigor. The entire potion must be consumed to achieve the desired result. It is also useful as a counter to magical or monsterbased aging attacks.

Each time one drinks a ''longevity'' potion, there isa 1% cumulative chance the effect will be the reverse of what the consumer wants—all age removed by previous drinks will be restored!

'''Oil of Acid Resistance:''' When this oil is applied to skin, cloth, or any other material, it confers virtual invulnerability against acid. The oil wears off, but slowly— one application lasts for a whole day (1440 rounds). Each time the protected material is exposed to acid, the duration of the oil is reduced by as many rounds as hit points of damage the acid would have caused to exposed flesh. Thus, if a black dragon breathes for 64 points of acid damage, a person protected by this oil would lose 1 hour and 4 minutes of protection (64 rounds—
32 if a saving throw vs. breath weapon was successful).

Each flask contains sufficient oil to protect one man-sized creature (and equipment) for 24 hours; to protect 24 man-sized creatures for one hour; or to protect any combination of creatures and duration between these extremes.

'''Oil of Disenchantment:''' This oil enables the removal of all enchantments and charms placed upon living things, and the suppression of such effects on objects. If the oil is rubbedon a creature, all enchantments and charms on it are immediately removed. If rubbed onto objects bearing an enchantment, the magic will be lost for 1d10 +20 turns. After this time, the oil loses potency and the item regains its enchantment. The oil does not radiate magic once it is applied, and masks the enchantment of whatever it coats, so that an item so coated will not show any enchantment for as long as the oil remains effective.

'''Oil of Elemental Invulnerability:''' This precious substance gives total invulnerability to one type of normal elemental force on the Prime Material plane: wind storms, fires, earth slides, floods, and so forth. There is a 10% chance that each such flask will also be effective on the appropriate Elemental plane—
this allows the protected individual to operate freely and without danger from elemental forces. Attacks by elemental creatures are still effective, but with a —1 penalty per die of damage. A flask contains enough oil to coat one man-sized creature for eight days or eight individuals for one day. The element protected against is determined randomly.

'''Oil of Etherealness:''' This potion is actually a light oil that is applied externally to clothes and exposed flesh, confering etherealness. In the ethereal state, the individual can pass through solid objects in any direction—sideways, upward, downward—or to different planes. The individual cannot touch non-ethereal objects.

The oil takes effect three rounds after application, and it lasts for 4+1d4 turns unless removed with a weak acidic solution prior to the expiration of its normal effective duration. It can be applied to objects as well as creatures. One potion is sufficient to anoint a normal human and such gear as he typically carries (two or three weapons, garments, armor, shield, and miscellaneous gear). Ethereal individuals are invisible.

'''Oil of Fiery Burning:''' When this oil is exposed to air, it immediately bursts into flame, inflicting Sd6 points of damage to any creature directly exposed to the substance (save vs. spell for half damage). If hurled, the flask will always break. Any creature within 10’ of the point of impact (up to a maximum of six creatures) will be affected. The oil can, for instance, be used to consume the bodies of as many as six regenerating creatures, such as trolls, If the flask is opened, the creature holding it immediately suffers 1d4 points of damage. Unless a roll equal to or less than the
creature’s Dexterity is made on 2d10, the flask cannot be re-stoppered in time to prevent the oil from exploding, with effects as described above.

'''Oil of Fumbling:''' This oil will seem to be of a useful type—''acid resistance'', ''slipperiness'', etc.—until the wearer is under stress in an actual melee situation. At that point, he has a 50% chance each round to fumble and drop whatever he holds—weapon, shield, spell components, and so forth. Only a thorough bath of some solvent (alcohol, etc.) will remove the oil before it wears off.

'''Oil of Impact:''' This oil has beneficial effects on blunt weapons and missiles, both magical and nonmagical. When applied to a blunt weapon such as a club, hammer, or mace, it bestowsa +3 bonus to attack rolls and a +6 bonus to damage. The effect lasts 1d4 +8 rounds per application. One application will treat one weapon,

When applied to a blunt missile, such as a hurled hammer, hurled club, sling stone, or bullet, it bestows a +3 bonus to attack rolls and a +3 bonus to damage. The effect lasts until the missile is used once. One application will treat 4-5 sling stones or two larger weapons. A flask of ''oil of impact'' holds 1d3+2 applications.

'''Oil of Slipperiness:''' Similar to the ''oil of etherealness'' described above, this liquid is to be applied externally. This application makes it impossible for the individual to be grabbed, grasped, or hugged by any opponent, or constricted by snakes or tentacles, (Note that a roper could still inflict weakness, but that the
monster’s tentacles could not entwine the opponent coated with ''oil of slipperiness''.)

in addition, such obstructions as webs, magical or otherwise, will not affect an anointed individual. Bonds such as ropes, manacles, and chains can be slipped free. Magical ropes and the like are not effective against this oil. If poured on a floor or on steps, there is a 95%
chance/round that creatures standing on the surface will slip and fall. The oil requires eight hours to wear off normally, or it can be wiped off with an alcohol solution (even wine!).

'''Oil of Timelessness:''' When this oil is applied to any matter that was once alive (leather, leaves, paper, wood, dead flesh, etc.). it allows that substance to resist the passage of time, Each year of actual time affects the substance as if only a day had passed. The coated object has a +1 bonus on all saving throws. The oil never wears off, although it can be magically removed. One flask contains enough oil to coat eight man-sized objects, or an equivalent area.

'''Philter of Glibness:''' This potion enables the imbiber to speak fluently—even tell lies—
smoothly, believably, and undetectably. Magical investigation (such as the 4th-level priest spell, ''detect lie'') will not give the usual results, but will reveal that some minor “stretching of the truth” might be occurring.

'''Philter of Love:''' This potion causes the individual drinking it to become charmed (see ''charm'' spells) with the first creature seen after consuming the draught. The imbiber may actually become enamored if the creature is of similar race and of the opposite sex, Charm effects wear off in 1d4+4 turns, but the enamoring effects last until a ''dispel magic'' spell is cast upon the individual.

'''Philter of Persuasiveness:''' When this potion is imbibed the individual becomes more charismatic, gaining a bonus of +5 on reaction dice rolls. The individual is also able to suggest (see the 3rd-level wizard spell, ''suggestion'') once per turn to all creatures within 30 yards of him.

'''Philter of Stammering and Stuttering:''' When this liquid is consumed, it will seem to be
beneficial—''philter of glibness'' or ''persuasiveness'', for instance. However, whenever a meaningful utterance must be spoken (the verbal component of a spell, the text of a scroll, negotiation with a monster, etc.), the potion’s
true effect is revealed—nothing can be said properly, and the reactions of all creatures hearing such nonsense will be at a —5 penalty,

'''Plant Control:''' A ''plant control'' potion enables the individual who consumes it to influence the behavior of vegetable life forms. This includes normal plants, fungi, and even molds and shambling mounds—within the parameters of their normal abilities. The imbiber can cause the vegetable forms to remain still or silent, move, entwine, etc., according to their limits.

Vegetable monsters with Intelligence of 5 or higher are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. Plants within a 20’ X 20’ square can be controlled, subject to the limitations set forth above, for 5d4 rounds. Self-destructive control is not directly possible if the plants are intelligent (see ''charm plants'' spell), Control range is 90 yards.

'''Poison:''' A poison potion is simply a highly toxic liquid in a potion flask. Typically, poison potions are odorless and can be of any color. Ingestion, introduction of the poison through a break in the skin, or, in some cases, just skin contact, will cause death, Poison can be ''weak'' (+4 to +1 bonus to the saving throw), ''average'', or'' deadly'' (—1to —4 penalty or greater on the saving throw). Some poison can be so toxic that a ''neutralize poison'' spell will simply lower the toxicity level by 40% —say, from a — 4 penalty to a +4 bonus to the saving throw vs. poison. The DM selects the strength of poison desired, although most are strength “J” (see page 73). You might wish to allow characters to hurl poison flasks (see Combat, p. 63).

'''Polymorph Self:''' This potion duplicates the effects of the 4th-level wizard spell of the same name.

'''Rainbow Hues:''' This rather syrupy potion must be stored in a metallic container. The imbiber can become any hue or combination ot hues desired at will. Any color or combination of colors is possible, if the user simply holds the thought in his mind long enough for the hue to be effected, li the potion is quaffed sparingly, a flask will yield up to seven draughts of one hour duration each.

'''Speed:''' A potion of speed increases the movement and combat capabilities of the imbiber by 100% . Thus, a movement rate of 9 becomes 18, and a character normally able to attack once per round attacks twice. This does not reduce spellcasting time, however. Use of a speed potion ages the individual by one year. The aging is permanent, but the other effects last for 5d4 rounds.

'''Super-Heroism:''' This potion gives the individual a temporary increase in levels (see ''heroism'' potion) if he has fewer than 13 levels of experience. It is similar to the ''heroism'' potion, but more powerful, and its effects last just 5d6 melee rounds:

'''Sweet Water:''' This liquid is not actually a potion to be drunk (though it tastes good). Sweet water is added to other liquids in order to change them to pure, drinkable water. It will neutralize poison and ruin magical potions (no saving throw). The contents of a single container will change up to 100,000 cubic feet of polluted, salt, or alkaline water to fresh water. It will turn up to 1,000 cubic feet of acid into pure water, The effects of the potion are permanent, but the liquid may be contaminated after an initial period of 5d4 rounds.

'''Treasure Finding:''' A p''otion of treasure finding'' empowers the drinker with a location sense, so that he can point to the direction of the nearest mass of treasure. The treasure must be within 240 yards, and its mass must equal metal of at least 10,000 copper pieces or 100 gems or any combination.

Note that only valuable metals (copper, silver, electrum, gold, platinum, etc.) and gems (and jewelry, of course) are located. The potion won’t locate worthless metals or magical items which don’t contain precious metals or gems. The imbiber of the potion can “feel”
the direction in which the treasure lies, but not its distance.

Intervening substances other than special magical wards or lead-lined walls will not withstand the powers that the liquor bestows upon the individual. The effects of the potion jast for 5d4 rounds. (Clever players will attempt triangulation.)

'''Undead Control:''' This potion in effect gives the imbiber the ability to charm certain ghasts, wights, wraiths, vampires, and zombies. The charm ability is similar to the Ist-evel wizard spell, ''charm person''. It affects a maximum of 16 Hit Dice of undead, rounding down any hit point additions to the lowest die (e.g., 4+1 equals 4 Hit Dice). The undead are entitled to saving throws vs. spell only if they have intelligence. Saving throws are rolled with —2 penalties due to the power of the potion; the effects wear off in 5d4 rounds. To determine the type of undead affected by a particular potion, roll 1d10 and consult the following table:
{| class="wikitable"

'''Ventriloquism:''' This allows the user to make his voice sound as if it (or someone’s
voice or a similar sound) were issuing from someplace other than where he is—from
another creature, a statue, from behind a door, down a passage, etc. The user can speak in any language he knows, or make any sound he can normally make. To detect the ruse, listeners must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell with a penalty of —2. If cast in conjunction with other illusions, the DM may rule greater penalties or disallow an independent saving throw against this effect—the combined illusion may be perfect! The imbiber can use the ''ventriloquism'' ability up to six times within the duration of the potion.

'''Vitality:''' This potion restores the user to full vitality despite exertion, lack of sleep, and going without food and drink for up to seven days. It will nullify up to seven days of deprivation, and will continue in effect for the remainder of its seven-day duration. The potion also makes the user proof against poison and disease while it is in effect, and the user will recover lost hit points at the rate of 1 every 4 hours.

'''Water Breathing:''' It is 75% likely that a ''water breathing'' potion will contain two doses, 25% probable that there will be four in the container. The potion allows the character drinking it to breathe normally in liquids that contain suspended oxygen. This ability lasts for one full hour per dose of potion quaffed, with an additional 1d10 rounds (minutes) variable. Thus, a character who has consumed a water breathing potion could enter the depths of a river, lake, or even the ocean and not drown while the magical effects of the potion persisted.

== Scrolls ==
Scrolls are generally found in cylinders—tubes of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood, Some tubes are inscribed with magic runes or writing PCs must read in order to open the container, This is up to the DM. Taking this approach encourages players to select and use ''read magic'' or ''comprehend languages'' spells. It also makes it possible to protect power scrolls with traps (''symbols'', ''explosive runes'') and ''curses''.

Each scroll is written in its own magical cypher. To understand what type of scroll has been found, the ability to ''read magic'' must be available, Once a scroll is read to determine its contents, a read magic spell is not needed at a subsequent time to invoke its magic. Even a scroll map will appear unreadable until the proper spell (''comprehend languages'') is used.

Reading a scroll to find its contents does not invoke its magic unless it is a specially triggered ''curse''. A ''cursed'' scroll can appear to be a scroll of any sort. It radiates no evil or special aura beyond being magical.

A ''protection'' scroll can be read by any class of character even without a ''read magic'' spell. If a scroll isn’t immediately read to determine its contents, there isa 5% to 30% chance it will fade. The DM sets the percentage or rolls 1d6 to determine it for each scroll,

When a spell scroll is examined, the following table can be used to find its nature:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D100
	! Roll
	|-
	| 01-70
	| Wizard
	|-
	| 71-00
	| Priest*
|}
Other classes in the priest group can, at the DM’s discretion, have unique scrolls as well. Only the indicated class of character can use the scroll, except thieves and bards, who can use any scroll, as explained in the ''Player’s
Handbook''.

=== Spell Level of Scroll Spells ===
All scroll spells are written to make use as quick and easy as possible for the writer. The level of the spell and its characteristics (range, duration, area of effect, etc.) are typically one level higher than that required to cast the spell, but never below 6th level of experience.

Thus, a 6th-level wizard spell is written at 13th level of ability, a 7th-level spell at 15th level, etc. The DM can make scroll spells more powertul by increasing the level at which they are written, This will, however, affect the chance of spell failure.

=== Magical Spell Fallure ===
If any spell-user acquires a scroll inscribed with a spell of a level too high for him to cast, he can still try to use the spell—the chance of failure, or other bad effect, is 5% per level difference between the
character’s present level and the level at which the spell could be used.

For example, a Ist-level mage finds a scroll with a wish spell inscribed upon it. The chance of failure is 85%, as ''wish'' is a 9th-level spell attained at 18th level; 18-1 = 17;17X5% =
85%. A percentile die roll of 85 or less indicates failure of some sort, and Table 112: is consulted. In this case, the spell is 30% likely to fail without effect, while the chance for a reverse or harmful effect is 70%.
{| class="wikitable"

|}

=== Use of Scroll Spells ===
When a scroll is copied into a spell book or read to release its magic, the writing completely and permanently disappears from the scroll. The magic content of the spell is bound up in the writing, and use releases and erases it. Thus, reading a spell from a scroll of seven spells makes the item a scroll of six spells, No matter what a player may try, each spell on a scroll is only usable once. Exceptions should be made very rarely and only when you have a very special magical item in mind—perhaps a scroll that can be read once per week, This would be potent magic indeed.

=== Casting Scroll Effects ===
The initiative modifier of a scroll is its reading time. For scroll spells, this is equal to the casting time of the spell, For ''protection'' scrolls, the reading time is given in the explanation of the scroll effects.

The only requirements for using a scroll are sufficient light to read by and the actual verbalization of the writings. If the reading of a scroll is interrupted, the scroll effect is lost and that spell fades away and is lost. Spell components are unnecessary for the scroll reader, and no adverse effects associated with casting the spell are suffered—these requirements or penalties have been fulfilled or suffered by the creator of the scroll.

=== Protection Scroll Effects ===
If a player character has more than one ''protection'' scroll, the effects are cumulative, but not the duration. Scrolls that protect against creatures do not create an actual, physical globe. If the user forces the creature into a place from which further retreat is impossible (e.g., a corner), and then continues forward until the creature would be within the radius of the circle, the creature is not harmed, and the protection is considered voluntarily broken and disappears. There is no way in which a protection scroll can be used as an offensive weapon.

=== Who Can Use Scroll Spells? ===
Ability to use scroll spells does not permit a priest to use a wizard spell, or a wizard to use a priest spell. Likewise, it does not extend the ability of spell use to non-spell-using characters except with respect to protection scrolls. Anyone can use a protection scroll. Paladins and rangers cannot use priest scrolls.

Those characters able to read and employ scroll spells can do so regardless of other restrictions. Once the spell is known, it is not necessary to use a ''read magic'' spell in order to invoke its powers. Scrolls can be read even by mages who are unable to employ the spell copied because of an inability to learn it or because it is too high level (although, in the latter case, there is a chance of spell failure).

=== Spell Level Range ===
The level range shown in Table 90 gives the parameters for random determination of spell level for scrolls if you choose not to set this yourself. With spell level determined, find the particular spell by consulting the appropriate Spell Tables in the
''Player’s Handbook''.

=== Cursed Scrolls ===
Some scrolls bear powerful ''curses'', placed intentionally or as a result of flawed scroll-making. ''Cursed'' scrolls take effect the instant they are first read. A ''cursed'' scroll can have any effect the DM desires, although few should be outright deadly. Suggested ''curses'' include the following:
* Bad luck (—1 on attacks and saving throws).
* The character’s beard grows 1” per minute,
* The character is teleported away from the real of the party.
* Random monster appears and attacks.
* The character is polymorphed into a mouse,
* The character shrinks to half his normal size.
* The character is stricken with weakness, halving his Strength score,
* The character falls into a deep sleep from which he can’t be roused.
* The character develops an uncontrollable appetite.
* The character must always talk in rhyme (preventing spellcasting).
* The character is blinded or deafened
* The character is stricken with cowardice and must make a morale check every time a monster is encountered.
* The character’s alignment is changed
* The character suffers 2-6 points of damage.
* The character suffers amnesia.
* The character feels compelled to give away all his belongings.
* The character must save vs. paralyzation or petrifaction, In general, the effects of a curse can be negated or reversed by a ''remove curse'', Some cases (such as ''petrification'') may require the use of other spells. Overcoming a curse should be difficult for the player characters, but not impossible.

=== Maps ===
While not magical, maps are special enough to require careful preparation and use by the DM, hence they are included in the listings of magical items. Maps should rarely be given out randomly—the DM must have a suitable map prepared in advance. There is no table to govern the nature of maps. All hint at or imply the existence of great treasures to be found while giving only a vague idea of the risks to be overcome. Some may be genuine, others fake. Because of the wide range of possibilities, the DM should use treasure maps as the springboard for new and exciting adventures.

=== List of Protection Scrolls ===
'''Protection from Acid:''' (Reading time—6) The reader is protected from all forms of acid, to a maximum damage of 20 Hit Dice or a maximum duration of 1d4 +8 turns, whichever occurs first.

'''Protection from Cold:''' (Reading time—3)
Protection extends outward from the reader to a 30’ diameter sphere. All within the area are protected from the effects of nonmagical cold to a temperature of absolute zero (-460°F). Against magical cold, the scroll confers a +6 bonus to saving throws and one-quarter damage (one-eighth if the saving throw is made), The duration of the scroll is 1d4 +4 turns.

'''Protection from Dragon Breath:''' (Reading
Time—variable) Only the individual reading the scroll is protected. Protection extends to all forms of dragon breath and lasts 2d4 +4 rounds.

'''Protection from Electricity:''' (Reading time—
5) Protection is provided in a 20’ diameter sphere centered on the reader. Those protected are immune to all electrical attacks and associated

'''Protection from Elementals:''' (Reading time—
6) There are 5 varieties of this scroll, Roll percentile dice and consult the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D100 Roll
	! Type of Scroll
	|-
	| 01-15
	| Protection from Air Elementals (including aerial servants, dijinn, invisible stalkers, and wind walkers)
	|-
	| 16-30
	| Protection from Earth Elementals (including xorn)
	|-
	| 31-45
	| Protection from Fire Elementals (including efreeti and salamanders)
	|-
	| 46-60
	| Protection from Water Elementals (including tritons and water weirds)
	|-
	| 61-00
	| Protection from all Elementals
|}

The magic protects the reader and all within
10’ of him from the type of elemental noted, as well as elemental creatures of the same plane(s). The protection affects a maximum of 24 Hit Dice of elemental creatures if the scroll is of a specific elemental type, 16 Hit Dice if it is against all sorts of elementals. The spell lasts for 5d8 rounds. Attack out of the circle is possible, as is attack into it by any elemental creature with more Hit Dice than are protected against or by several elemental creatures—
those in excess of the protected number of Hit Dice are able to enter and attack.

'''Protection from Fire:''' (Reading time—8)
Protection extends to a 30’ diameter sphere centered on the reader. All in this area are able to withstand flame and heat of the hottest type, even of magical and elemental nature. The protection lasts 1d4 +4 turns.

'''Protection from Gas:''' (Reading time—3)
This scroll generates a 10’ diameter sphere of protection centered on the reader. All within the area are immune to the effects of any gas—
poison gas, gaseous breath weapons, spells 146 that generate gas (such as ''stinking cloud'' and ''cloudkill''), and all similar forms of noxious, toxic vapors. The protection lasts for 1d4+4 rounds.

'''Protection from Lycanthropes:''' (Reading
time—4) There are seven common types of this scroll, The DM can select one from the table below or make a percentile roll to determine it randomly:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D100 Roll
	! Scroll Type
	|-
	| 01-05
	| Protection from Werebears
	|-
	| 06-10
	| Protection from Wereboars
	|-
	| 11-20
	| Protection from Wererats
	|-
	| 21-25
	| Protection from Weretigers
	|-
	| 26-40
	| Protection from Werewolves
	|-
	| 41-98
	| Protection from all Lycanthropes
	|-
	| 99-00
	| Protection from ShapeChangers
|}
The magical circle from the reading of the scroll extends in a 10’ radius and moves with the reader. Each scroll protects against 49 Hit Dice of lycanthropes, rounding all hit point pluses down unless they exceed +2. The protection is otherwise similar to that against elementals, above. The ''protection from shape-changers'' scroll protects against monsters (except gods and god-like creatures) able to change their form to that of man: dopplegangers, certain dragons, druids, jackalweres, and lycanthropes, for example. The magic lasts for 5d6 rounds.

'''Protection from Magic:''' (Reading tirme—8)
This scroll invokes a very powerful, invisible globe of anti-magic in a 5’ radius from the reader. No form of magic can pass into or out of it, but physical things are not restricted by the globe. As with other protections, the globe of anti-magic moves with its invoker. The protection lasts for Sdé rounds.

'''Protection from Petrification:''' (Reading
time—5) A 10° radius circle of protection extends from, and moves with, the reader of this scroll. Everyone within its confines is absolutely immune to all attack forms, magical or otherwise, that turn flesh to stone. The protection lasts for 5d4 rounds.

'''Protection from Plants:''' (Reading time—1
round). A protective sphere 10’ in diameter is centered on the reader. All forms of vegetable life (including fungi, slimes, molds, and the like) are unable to penetrate the sphere. If it is moved toward plant life that is capable of movement, the plant will be pushed away. If the plant is immobile (a well-rooted shrub, bush, or tree, for instance), the sphere cannot be moved through or past it unless the reader has enough strength and mass to uproot the plant under normal conditions. The protection lasts for 1d4 +4 turns.

'''Protection from Poison:''' (Reading time—3)
The protection afforded by this scroll extends only to the reader. No form of poison—
ingested, contacted, breathed, etc.—will affect the protected individual, and any poison in the
reader’s system is permanently neutralized. The protection otherwise lasts 1d10 +2 rounds,

'''Protection from Possession:''' (Reading
time—1 round) This scroll generates a magical circle of 10° radius that extends from, and moves with, the reader. All creatures within its confines are protected from ''possession'' by magical spell attacks such as ''magic jar'' or attack forms aimed at possession or mental control, Even the dead are protected if they are within the magic circle. The protection lasts for 10d6 rounds in 90% of these scrolls; 10%
have power that lasts 10d6 turns, but the spell effect is stationary.

'''Protection from Undead:''' (Reading time—
4) When this scroll is read, a 5‘ radius circle of protection extends from, and moves with, the reader. [t protects everyone within it from all physical attacks made by undead (ghasts, ghosts, ghouls, shadows, skeletons, spectres, wights, wraiths, vampires, zombies, etc,) but not magical spells or other attack forms. If a creature leaves the protected area, it is subject to physical attack. The protection restrains up to 35 Hit Dice/levels of undead; excess Hit Dice/levels can pass through the circle, lt remains in effect for 10d8 rounds. Some protection scrolls of this nature protect only against certain types of undead (one or more)
rather than all undead, at the DM’s option. (See Potions, Undead Control for a die roll table.)

'''Protection from Water:''' (Reading time—6)
This protection extends in a 10’ diameter sphere centered on the reader. All forms of
water—liquid, solid, and vapor, ice, hail, snow, sleet, steam, and so forth—are unable to penetrate the sphere of protection. If those protected come upon a form of water, the substance simply will not touch them; thus, they will not slip on ice, sink into a body of water, etc. The protection lasts for 1d4 +4 turns.

== Rings ==
All magical rings normally radiate magic, but most are impossible to detect as magical rings without some mystic means. Furthermore, all magical rings look alike, so determination of a given ring’s
magical powers is difficult. The ring must be put on and various things tried in order to find what it does, No ring radiates good or evil,

No more than two magical rings can be worn by a character at the same time. If more are worn, none will function. No more than one magical ring can be worn on the same hand. A second ring worn on one hand causes both to be useless. Rings must be worn on the fingers. Rings on toes, in ear lobes, etc., do not function as magical rings.

The spell-like abilities of rings function as 12thlevel magic unless the power requires a higher level. In cases where a higher level is necessary, rings function at the minimum level of magic use needed to cast the equivalent spell.

Magical rings can be worn and used by all character classes and humans/humanoids not specifically prohibited elsewhere. You might allow “monsters” with digits to wear rings, and some can actually benefit from them. For example, a troll could wear a ''ring of regeneration'' and gain its benefits in addition to its normal regenerative abilities.

=== List of Rings ===
'''Ring of Animal Friendship:''' When the wearer of this ring approaches within 10’ of any animals of neutral alignment and animal intelligence, the creatures must roll saving throws vs. spell. If they succeed, they move rapidly away from the ring wearer. If the saving throws fail, the creatures become docile and follow the ring wearer around. The item functions at 6th level, so up to 12 Hit Dice of animals can be affected by this ring.

Animals feeling friendship for the wearer will actually guard and protect that individual if he expends a charge from the ring to cause such behavior. A ring of this sort typically has 27 charges when discovered, and it cannot be recharged. A druid wearing this ring can influence twice the prescribed Hit Dice worth of animals (24 rather than 12), and a ranger is able to influence 18 Hit Dice worth of animals.

'''Ring of Blinking:''' When the wearer of this ring issues the proper verbal command, the item activates, and he is affected as if a ''blink'' spell were rounds. The ring then ceases to function for six turns (one hour) while it replenishes tself. The command word is usually engraved somewhere word is spoken, even though the command might be given by someone other than the wearer, provided that the word is spoken within 10° of the ring.

'''Ring of Chameleon Power:''' Whenever the wearer of this ring desires, he is able to magically blend in with the surroundings. This enables 90% invisibility in foliage, against walls, and so forth.

If the wearer is associating with creatures of Intelligence 4 or greater at a distance of 60° or less, the ring enables the wearer to seem to be one of those creatures, but each turn of such association carries a 5% cumulative chance that the creatures will detect the ring wearer for what he is. Thus, such an association can never persist for more than 20 turns without the wearer being detected—at the end of that time, the chance of detection has risen to 100%. Creatures with 16 or greater Intelligence use their Intelligence score as an addition to the base chance of detection. For example, a creature of Intelligence 16 would have a base chance of (16 + 5%) = 21% at the end of turn 1, 26% at the end of turn 2, and so forth. Creatures with 3 or lower Intelligence instinctively and automatically detect the wearer if they come within a 10’ radius of him.

'''Ring of Clumsiness:''' This cursed ring typically radiates an aura like another, beneficial, ring to disguise its banefull nature. The possible secondary powers are:
{| class="wikitable"
	| 01-10
	| Free action
	|-
	| 11-20
	| Feather falling
	|-
	| 21-35
	| Invisibility
	|-
	| 36-50
	| Jumping
	|-
	| 51-60
	| Swimming
	|-
	| 61-80
	| Warmth
	|-
	| 81-100
	| Water walking
|}
The secondary power works normally, except when the wearer is under stress—
combat, stealth, delicate activity, and the
like—at which time the ''clumsiness'' takes effect. Dexterity is lowered to half normal, rounded down. Chances for stealth and precise actions are also lowered by one-half, rounded down, Any attempt at spellcasting that requires the handling of a material component or the accomplishment of a somatic component will succeed only if the wearer rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell; otherwise, the spell is botched and annulled.

The ring can be taken off only by a successfully cast ''dispel magic'' spell (vs. 12th-level magic). Success destroys both the primary and secondary power of the ring.

'''Ring of Contrariness:''' This magical ring is cursed, making its wearer unable to agree with any idea, statement, or action, Once put on, the ring can be removed only after a ''remove curse'' spell is cast upon the individual wearing it. Because of the curse, the wearer will resist any attempts to cast such a spell. The ''contrariness'' ring will have one of the following additional magical properties:
{| class="wikitable"
	| 01-20
	| Flying
	|-
	| 21-40
	| Invisibility
	|-
	| 41-60
	| Levitation
	|-
	| 61-70
	| Shocking Grasp (once per round)
	|-
	| 71-80
	| Spell Turning
	|-
	| 81-00
	| Strength (18/00)
|}
Note that contrariness can never be removed from the ring. The wearer will use his own powers, plus those of the ring, to retain it on his finger. The wearer of the ring will never damage himself. If, for example, other characters suggest that the wearer make certain that attacks upon him are well-defended against, or that he should not strike his own head, the ring wearer will agree —possibly attacking or striking at the speaker’s head—because obviously the result must be contrary in this case. If a ''ring of contrariness'' turns spells, the cumulative ''remove curse'' cast upon the individual wearing it must equal or exceed 100%.

'''Ring of Delusion:''' A ''delusion'' ring convinces the wearer that it is some other sort of ring —whatever sort the wearer really desires. The wearer will be completely convinced that the ring is actually one with other magical properties, and he will unconsciously use his abilities of any sort (including those of other magical items available) to produce a result commensurate with the supposed properties of the ''delusion'' ring. The DM determines how successful the self-delusion is, as well as how observers are affected and what they will observe, The ring can be removed at any time.

'''Ring of Djinni Summoning:''' One of the many fabled rings of fantasy legend, the “genie” ring is most useful indeed, for it is a special
“gate” by means of which a certain djinni can be summoned from the elemental plane of Air. When the ring is rubbed, the summons is served, and the djinni will appear on the next round. The djinni will faithfully obey and serve the wearer of the ring, but if the servant of the ring is ever killed, the ring becomes nonmagical and worthless. See the ''Monstrous Compendium'' for details of a djinni’s abilities,

'''Ring of Elemental Command:''' The four types of elemental command rings are very powerful, Each appears to be nothing more than an ordinary ring,but each has certain other powers as well as the following common properties:

1. Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can’t attack or even approach within
5’ of the wearer. If the wearer desires, he may forego this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (saving throw applicable with a —2 penalty to the die). lf the charm fails, however, total protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made, but the secondary properties given below will then function with respect to the elemental.

2. Creatures, other than normal elementals, from the plane to which the ring is attuned attack with —1 penalties to their attack rolls. The ring wearer takes damage at —1 on each Hit Die and makes applicable saving throws from the creature’s attacks at +2. All attacks are made by the wearer of the ring with a +4 bonus to the attack roll (or ~4 on the elemental creature’s saving throw), and the wearer inflicts +6 damage (total, not per die) adjusted by any other applicable bonuses and penalties. Any weapon used by the ring wearer can hit elementals or elemental creatures even if it is not magical,

3. The wearer of the ring is able to converse with the elementals or elemental creatures of the plane to which the ring is attuned, These creatures will recognize that he wears the ring, and will show a healthy respect for the wearer, if alignments are similar. If alignment is opposed, creatures will fear the wearer if he is strong, hate and desire to slay him if the wearer is weak. Fear, hatred, and respect are determined by the DM.

4. The possessor of a ring of elemental command suffers a saving throw penalty as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
	| Air
	| -2 vs. fire
	|-
	| Earth
	| -2 vs. petrification
	|-
	| Fire
	| -2 vs. water or cold
	|-
	| Water
	| -2 vs. lightning/electricity
|}
5. Only one of the powers of a ring of ''elemental command'' can be in use at any given time.

In addition to the powers described above, the ring gives characters the following abilities:

: ''Air''
* ''Gust of wind'' (once per round)
* ''Fly''
* ''Wall of force'' (once per day)
* ''Control winds'' (once per week)
* ''Invisibility''

The ring will appear to be an invisibility ring until a certain condition is met (having the ring blessed, slaying an air elemental, or whatever the DM determines as necessary to activate its full potential).

: ''Earth''
* ''Stone tel''l (once per day)
* ''Passwall'' (twice per day)
* ''Wall of stone'' (once per day)
* ''Stone to flesh'' (twice per week)
* ''Move earth'' (once per week)
* ''Feather fall''

The ring will appear to be a ''ring of feather falling'' until the DM-established condition is met.

: ''Fire''
* ''Burning hands'' (once per turn)
* ''Pyrotechnics'' (twice per day)
* ''Wall of fire'' (once per day)
* ''Flame strike'' (twice per week)
* ''Fire resistance''

The ring will appear to be a ''ring of fire'' resistance until the DM-established condition is met.

: ''Water''
* ''Purify water''
* ''Create water'' (once per day)
* '' Water breathing'' (5’ radius)
* ''Wall of ice'' (once per day)
* ''Airy water''
* ''Lower water'' (twice per week)
* ''Part water'' (twice per week)
* ''Water walking'' The ring will appear to be a ''ring of water walking'' until the DM-established condition is met.

These rings operate at 12th level of experience, or the minimum level needed to perform the equivalent magical spell, if greater. The additional powers have an initiative modifier of +5,

'''Ring of Feather Falling:''' This ring protects its wearer by automatic activation of a ''feather fall'' if the individual falls 5’ or more. (See the ''feather fall'' spell in the ''Player’s Handbook''.)

'''Ring of Fire Resistance:''' The wearer of this ring is totally immune to the effects of normal
fires—torches, flaming oil, bonfires, etc. Very large and hot fires, molten lava, hell-hound breath, or a ''wall of fire'' spell will cause 10 hit points of damage per round if the wearer is directly within the conflagration.

Exceptionally hot fires such as red-dragon breath, pyrohydra breath, fireballs, flame strike, fire storm, etc., are saved against with a +4 bonus tothe die roll, and all damage dice are calculatedat —2 per die, but each die is never less than 1 in any event. As a ruleof thumb, consider very hot fires as those that have a maximum initial exposure of up to 24 hit points, those of exceptional heat (25 or more hit points).

'''Ring of Free Action:''' This ring enables the wearer to move and attack freely and normally even when attacked by a ''web'', ''hold'', or ''slow'' spell, or even while under water. The spells simply have no effect. While under water, the individual moves at normal (surface) speed and does full damage even with cutting weapons (like axes and scimitars) and with smashing weapons (like flails, hammers, and maces), insofar as the weapon used is held rather than hurled. This will not, however, enable breathing under water without further appropriate magic.

'''Ring of Human Influence:''' This ring has the effect of raising the wearer’s Charisma to 18 on encounter reactions with humans and humanoids, The wearer can make a ''suggestion'' to any human or humanoid (saving throw applies). The wearer can also ''charm'' up to 21 levels/Hit Dice of human/humanoids (saving throws apply) just as if he were using the wizard spell, ''charm person'', The two latter uses of the ring are applicable but once per day. ''Suggestion'' or ''charm'' has an initiative penalty of +3.

'''Ring of Invisibility:''' The wearer of an ''invisibility rin''g is able to become invisible at will, instantly, This non-visible state is exactly the same as the wizard ''invisibility'' spell, except that 10% of these rings have ''inaudibility'' as well, making the wearer absolutely silent. If the wearer wishes to speak, he breaks all silence features in order to do so.

'''Ring of Jumping:''' The wearer of this ring is able to leap 30’ ahead or 10’ backward or straight up, with an arc of about 2’ for every
10’ traveled (see the Ist-level wizard spell, ''jump''). The wearer must use the ring’s power Sane for it can perform only four times per ay.

'''Ring of Mammal Control:''' This ring enables its wearer to exercise complete control over mammals with Intelligence of 4 or less (animal or semi-intelligent mammals). Up to 30 Hit Dice of mammals can be controlled. The wearer’s contro] over creatures is so great he can even command them to kill themselves, but complete concentration is required. (Note: the ring does not affect bird-mammal combinations, humans, semi-humans, and monsters such as lammasu, shedu, manticores, etc.) If the DM is in doubt about whether any creature can be controlled by the wearer of this ring, assume it can’t be controlled.

'''Ring of Mind Shielding:''' This ring is usually of fine workmanship and wrought from heavy gold. The wearer is completely immune to ''ESP'' ''detect lie'', and ''know alignment''.

'''Ring of Protection:''' A ''ring of protection'' improves the wearer’s Armor Class value and saving throws versus all forms of attack. A ''ring +1'' betters AC by 1 (say, from 10 to 9) and gives a bonus of +1 on saving throw die rolls. The magical properties of a ''ring of protection'' are cumulative with all other magical items of protection except as follows:
# The ring does not improve Armor Class if magical armor is worn, although it does add to saving throw die rolls.
# Multiple ''rings of protection'' operating on the same person, or in the same area, do not combine protection. Only one such ring—the
strongest—functions, so a pair of ''protection rings'' +2 provides only +2 protection. To determine the value of a ''protection ring'', use the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D100 Roll
	! Level of Protection
	|-
	| 01-70
	| +1
	|-
	| 71-82
	| +2
	|-
	| 83
	| +2, 5’ radius protection
	|-
	| 84-90
	| +3
	|-
	| 91
	| +3, 5’ radius protection
	|-
	| 92-97
	| +40n AC, +2 to saving throws
	|-
	| 98-00
	| +6 on AC, +1 to saving throws
|}
The radius bonus of 5’ extends to all creatures within its circle, but applies only to their saving throws (i.e., only the ring wearer gains Armor Class additions).

'''Ring of the Ram:''' This ornate ring can be of any hard metal, usually a silver alloy or iron. It has the head of a ram (or a buck goat) as its device. Anyone who attempts a ''detect magic'' on the ring discovers an ''evocation'' upon it.

The wearer can cause the ring to give forth a ram-like force, manifested by a vaguely discernible shape which resembles the head of a ram or goat, This force strikes one target for 1d6 points of damage if one charge is expended, 2d6 points if two charges are used, or 3d6 points if three charges (the maximum) are used, The ring is quite useful for knocking opponents off walls or ladders, or over ledges, among other things. The force of the blow is considerable, and a victim who fails to save versus spell is knocked down. The range of this power is 30’. The target of the blow applies adjustments to the saving throw from the following list:
{| class="wikitable"
	| Target smaller than man-sized
	| -1
	|-
	| Larger than man-sized
	| +2
	|-
	| Strength under 12
	| -1
	|-
	| Strength of 18-20
	| +3
	|-
	| Strength over 20
	| +6
	|-
	| 4 or more legs
	| +4
	|-
	| Over 1,000 lbs, weight
	| +2
	|-
	| 2 charges expended
	| -1
	|-
	| 3 charges expended
	| -2
|}
The DM can make circumstantial adjustments according to need. For instance, a fire giant balanced on a narrow ledge should not gain any benefit from Strength and weight unless he knows that he about to be struck by the force of the ring. This is a case where common sense will serve best.

In addition to its attack mode, the ''ring of the ram'' also has the power to open doors as if a person of 18/00 Strength were doing so. If two charges are expended, the effect is as for a character of 19 Strength, and if three charges are expended, the effect is as if a 20 Strength were used. Magically ''held'' or ''locked'' portals can be opened in this manner.

Structural damage from the ramlike force is identical to an actual battering ram, with double or triple damage accruing for applications of two or three charges. Magical items struck by the ramlike force must save versus ''crushing blow'' if three charges are used; otherwise, the force will not affect them. Nonmagical items which are the target of the force save versus ''crushing blow'' from the impact,

A ring of this sort will have from 6 to 10 charges when discovered. It can be recharged by a wizard employing ''enchant an item'' and
''Bigby’s clenched fist'' in combination.

'''Ring of Regeneration:''' The standard ''ring of regeneration'' restores one point of damage per turn (and will eventually replace lost limbs or organs). It will bring its wearer back from death. (If death was caused by poison, however, a saving throw must be successfully rolled or the wearer dies again from the poison still in his system.) Only total destruction of all living tissue by fire or acid or similar means will prevent regeneration, Of course, the ring must be worn, and its removal stops the regeneration processes.

A rarer kind of ''ring of regeneration'' is the ''vampiric regeneration ring''. This bestows onehalf (fractions dropped) of the value of hit points of damage the wearer inflicts upon opponents in hand-to-hand (melee, non-missile, non-spell) combat immediately upon its wearer. It does not otherwise cause regeneration or restore life, limb, or organ. For example, if a character wearing the ring inflicts 10 points of damage, he adds five to his current hit point total. The creature struck still loses 10 points.

To determine which type of ring is discovered, roll percentile dice:
{| class="wikitable"
	| 01-90
	| ''ring of regeneration''
	|-
	| 91-00
	| ''vampiric regeneration ring''
|}
In no case can the wearer’s hit points exceed his usual maximum.

'''Ring of Shocking Grasp:''' This ordinary seeming ring radiates only a faint, unidentifiable aura of magic when examined, but it contains a strong enchantment, capable of inflicting damage on an opponent. If the wearer touches an enemy with the hand upon which the ring is worn, a successful attack roll delivers 1d8 +6 points of damage to the target.

After three discharges of this nature, regardless of the time elapsed between them, the ring becomes inert for one turn. When actually functioning, this ring causes a circular, charged extrusion to appear on the palm of the
wearer’s hand.

'''Ring of Shooting Stars:''' This ring has two modes of operation—at night and
underground—both of which work only in relative darkness, During night hours, under the open sky, the ''shooting stars'' ring will perform the following functions:

* ''Dancing lights'' (once per hour).
* ''Light'', as the spell of the same name (twice per night), 120’ range.
* ''Ball lightning'', as described below (once per night).
* ''Shooting star''s (special).

The ''ball lightning'' function releases 1d4 balls of lightning, at the wearer’s option, These glowing globes resemble dancing lights, and the ring wearer controls them as he would control ''dancing lights''. These spheres have a 120’
range and a four round duration. They can be moved at 120’ per round. Each sphere is about 3’ in diameter, and any creature it touches or approaches within 5’ dissipates its charge (a successful save vs. spell halves damage—the
contact was across an air gap). The charge values are:
{| class="wikitable"
	| 4 lightning balls
	| 2d4 points damage each
	|-
	| 3 lightning balls
	| 2d6 points damage each
	|-
	| 2 lightning balls
	| 5d4 points damage each
	|-
	| 1 lightning ball
	| 4d12 points damage
|}
Release can be one at a time or all at once, during the course of one round or as needed throughout the night.

The ''shooting stars'' are glowing missiles with fiery trails, much like a ''meteor swarm''. Three shooting stars can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. They impact for 12 points of damage and burst (as a ''fireball'') in a 10’ diameter sphere for 24 points of damage.

Any creature struck takes full damage from impact plus full damage from the shooting star burst. Creatures within the burst radius must roll a saving throw vs. spell to take only onehalf damage (i.e., 12 points of damage, otherwise they, too, receive the full 24 points of damage). Range is 70’, at the end of which the burst will occur, unless an object or creature is struck before that. The shooting stars follow a straight line path. A creature in the path must roll a saving throw vs. spell or be hit by the missile. Saving throws suffer a —3 penalty within 20’ of the ring wearer, ~1 from 21’ to
40’, normal beyond 40’.

Indoors at night, or underground, the ring of shooting stars has the folowing properties:
* ''Faerie fire'' (twice per day)—as the spell
* ''Spark shower'' (once per day)
The ''spark shower'' is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks, which fan out from the ring for a distance of 20’ to a breadth of 10’. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if no metal armor is worn and/or no metal weapon is held. Characters wearing metal armor or carrying a metal weapon receive 4d4 points of damage.

Range, duration, and area of effect of functions are the minimum for the comparable spell unless otherwise stated. Casting time is 5.

'''Ring of Spell Storing:''' A ''ring of spell storing'' contains 1d4+1 spells which the wearer can employ as if he were a spellcaster of the level required to use the stored spells, The class of spells contained within the ring is determined in the same fashion as the spells on scrolls (see “Scrolls,” page 146). The level of each spell is determined by rolling 1d6 (for priests) or 1d8 (for wizards). The number rolled is the level of the spell, as follows:
:Priest: 1d6, if 6 is rolled, roll 1d4 instead
:Wizard: 1d8, if 8 is rolled, roll 1d6 instead

Which spell type of any given level is contained by the ring is also randomly determined.

The ring empathically imparts to the wearer the names of its spells. Once spell class, level, and type are determined, the properties of the ring are fixed and unchangeable. Once a spell is cast from the ring, it can be restored only by a character of appropriate class and level of experience (i.e., a 12th-level wizard is needed to restore a 6th-levels—a magical spell to the ring). Stored spells have a casting time of five.

'''Ring of Spell Turning:''' This ring distorts the three normal dimensions, causing many spells cast at the wearer to rebound upon the spellcaster, Sometimes, a spell’s entire effect is turned against the caster; sometimes, a portion of the effect rebounds. Some spells are immune from the effects of a ''ring of spell turning'':
# Spells that affect an area, and which are not cast directly at the ring wearer, are not turned by the ring.
# Spells that are delivered by touch are not turned.
# Magic contained in devices (rods, staves, wands, rings, and other iterns) that are triggered without spellcasting are not turned. A scroll spell is not considered a device,

When a spell is cast at an individual wearing a ''ring of spell turning'', 1d10 is rolled and the result is multiplied by 10. This score indicates what percentage of the spell has been turned back upon its caster.

Once the spell is turned, the effects must be determined. If the spell normally allows a saving throw, the intended target (the one wearing the ring) gains an automatic plus equal to the number rolled on the turning die. The caster receives a bonus equal to the number rolled on this die subtracted from 10. For example, a ''charm person'' spell is cast at a character wearing a ''ring of spell turning''. A 7 is rolled on the die, turning back 70% of the effect, The ringwearer gains a +7 to his saving throw; the caster has a +3.

A saving throw is also allowed for spells which normally do not have one if 20% to 80% of the effect is turned. The saving throw adjustment is calculated as given above. No further adjustments are made for race, magical items, or any other condition including existing spells, To save, the character must have a modified die roll of 20 or greater. If the saving throw is made, the effect of the spell is negated. For example, an illusionist casts a ''maze'' spell at a fighter wearing a ''ring of spell turning''. The spell normally allows no saving throw, but the ring turns 70% of the effect, The fighter is allowed a saving throw with a +7 modifier. The illusionist must also save, gaining only a +3. The fighter’s die roll is 15, which saves (15 + 7
= 22); the illusionist’s die roll is a 16 which, while close, fails (16 + 3 = 19). The illusionist becomes trapped in his own ''maze'' spell.

Once a spell is turned, the effects are divided proportionately between the two targets. If the spell causes damage, determine the damage normally and then assess the amount to each according to the percentage determined, rounding fractions to the nearest whole number. If a spell caused 23 points of damage, and 30% of it was turned, the intended victim would suffer 16 points of damage, while the caster would suffer 7. Durations are affected in a similar manner, In the above case, the spell duration would be 30% of its normal length for one character and 70% for the other. The effect of permanent spells for both characters remains unchanged.

Some spells affect a certain number of levels. When one of these is aimed at the ring wearer, the spell must be able to affect as many levels as the wearer and the spellcaster combined. If this condition is fulfilled, then the procedure above applies.

If the spellcaster and spell recipient both wear'' spell turning rings'' a resonating field is set up, and one of the following results will take place:
{| class="wikitable"
	| 01-70
	| Spell drains away without effect
	|-
	| 71-80
	| Spell affects both at full effect
	|-
	| 81-97
	| Both rings permanently lose their magic
	|-
	| 98-00
	| Both individuals go through a rift
|}
into the Pasitive Material plane A ring wearer who wants to receive a spell must remove the ''ring of spell turning'' to be able to do so.

'''Ring of Sustenance:''' This magical ring provides its wearer with life-sustaining nourishment even though he or she might go for days without food or drink. The ring also refreshes the body and mind, so that its wearer needs to sleep only two hours per day to gain the benefit of eight hours of sleep.

The ring must be worn for a full week in order to function properly, If it is removed, the wearer immediately loses its benefit and must wear it for another week to reattune it to himself. After functioning for any period of seven consecutive days, a ''ring of sustenance'' will cease to function for a week while it replenishes itself.

'''Ring of Swimming:''' The ''ring of swimming'' bestows upon the wearer the ability to swim at a full 21 base speed. (This assumes, of course, that the wearer is clad in garments appropriate for such activity.) The ring further enables the wearer to dive up to 50’ into water without injury, providing the depth of the water is at least
1½ feet per 10’ of diving elevation, The wearer can stay underwater for up to four rounds without needing a breath of air. Surface swimming can continue for four hours before a one hour (floating) rest is needed. The ring confers the ability to stay afloat under all but typhoonlike conditions.

'''Ring of Telekinesis:''' This ring enables the wearer to manipulate objects in the same manner as the Sth-level wizard spell, telekinesis. The amount of weight the wearer can move varies. Roll percentile dice to find the strength of the ring:
{| class="wikitable"
	| 01-25
	| 25 Lbs. maximum
	|-
	| 26-50
	| 50 Lbs. maximum
	|-
	| 51-89
	| 100 Lbs. maximum
	|-
	| 90-99
	| 200 Lbs. maximum
	|-
	| 00
	| 400 Lbs. maximum
|}

'''Ring of Truth:''' There is little doubt that wearing a ''ring of truth'' is a mixed blessing. The wearer can detect ary lie told to him, but he is unable to tell any sort of falsehood himself. If the wearer tries to tell a lie, he finds himself speaking the literal truth instead. On the plus side, the wearer is able to discern the last lie told by another—in fact, the power of the ring causes the voice of the liar to rise to a falsetto.

If the wearer of the ring encounters magic that enables falsehoods to be spoken without detection (such as an ''undetectable lie'' spell or a ''philter of glibness''), no lie is detected. However, the ring wearer will find himself unable to hear the voice of the person so influenced, whether or not he is trying to listen. This, of course, reveals the lie indirectly.

'''Ring of Warmth:''' This ring provides its wearer with body heat even in conditions of extreme cold where the wearer has no clothing whatsoever, It also restores damage caused by cold at the rate of one point per turn. It provides a saving throw bonus of +2 versus coldbased attacks, and reduces damage sustained by —1 per die.

'''Ring of Water Walking:''' This ring enables the wearer to walk on any liquid without sinking into it—this includes mud, quicksand, oil, running water, and even snow. Up to 1,200 pounds can be supported by a ''ring of water walking''. The ring wearer’s feet do not actually contact the surface he is walking upon (but oval depressions about 1½” deep per 100 pounds of weight of the walker will be observed in hardening mud or set snow). The wearer moves at his standard movement rate.

'''Ring of Weakness:''' This cursed ring causes the wearer to lose 1 point of Strength and 1 point of Constitution per turn until the individual reaches three in each ability. This loss is not noticeable until the individual actually observes his weakened state through some exertion (such as combat or heavy lifting). The ring can also make the wearer invisible at will (at the cost of double the standard rate of Strength and Constitution loss). When the affected abilities reach 3, the wearer will be unable to function in his class.

Points lost from the ring are restored by rest on a one-for-one basis, with 1 point of each ability lost being restored in one day of rest. The ''ring of weakness'' can be removed only if a ''remove curse'' spell, followed by a dispel magic, is cast upon the ring.

There is a 5% chance that this procedure will reverse the ring’s effect, changing it to a ''ring of berserk strength''. This increases Strength and Constitution at a rate of 1 point per ability per turn, to a maximum of 18 each (roll percentile dice for bonus Strength if the wearer is a warrior), However, once 18 is reached in both abilities, the wearer will immediately melee with any opponent he meets, regardless of circumstances. Berserk strength is lost when the ring is removed (by casting a ''remove curse''), as are Constitution points gained.

'''Ring of Wishes, Multiple:''' This ring contains from 2d4 ''wish'' spells. As with any wish, the DM should be very judicious in handling the request. If players are greedy and grasping, interpret their wording exactly, twist the wording, or simply rule the request is beyond the power of the magic, In any case, the wish is used up, whether or not the wish was granted, and regardless of the DM’s interpretation of the wisher’s request. No wish can cancel the decrees of god-like beings, unless it comes from another such creature.

'''Ring of Wishes, Three:''' This ring contains three ''wish'' spells instead of a variable number. It is otherwise the same as a ''multiple wish'' ring except that 25% (01-25) of ''three wish'' rings contain only ''limited wish'' spells.

'''Ring of Wizardry:''' This ring doubles the number of spells a wizard may prepare each day in one or more spell levels. Only wizards can benefit trom a ''ring of wizardry''. Other classes, even those with spell ability, can neither use nor understand the working of such a ring. To determine the properties of a given ring use the table below:
{| class="wikitable"
	| 01-50
	| doubles 1st-level spells
	|-
	| 51-75
	| doubles 2nd-level spells
	|-
	| 76-82
	| doubles 3rd-level spells
	|-
	| 83-88
	| doubles 1st- and 2nd-level spells
	|-
	| 89-92
	| doubles 4th-level spells
	|-
	| 93-95
	| doubles 5th-level spells
	|-
	| 96-99
	| doubles 1st- through 3rd-level spells
	|-
	| 00
	| doubles 4th- and 5th-level spells
|}

'''Ring of X-Ray Vision:''' This ring gives its possessor the ability to see into and through substances that are impenetrable to normal sight. Vision range is 20’, with the viewer seeing as if he were looking at something in normal light. X-ray vision can penetrate 20’ of cloth, wood, or similar animal or vegetable material, and up to 10’ of stone or some metals (some metals can’t be penetrated at all):
{| class="wikitable"
	! Substance Scanned
	! Thickness Penetrated per Round of X-Raying
	! Maximum Thickness
	|-
	| Animal matter
	| 4’
	| 20’
	|-
	| Vegetable matter
	| 2½’
	| 20’
	|-
	| Stone
	| 1’
	| 10’
	|-
	| Iron, Steel, etc.
	| 1”
	| 10”
	|-
	| Lead, Gold. Platinum
	| nil
	| nil
|}

It is possible to scan up to 100 square feet of area during one round. Thus, during one round, the wearer of the ring could scan an area of stone 10’ wide and 10’ high. Alternatively, he could scan an area 5’ wide and 20’ high.

Secret compartments, drawers, recesses, and doors are 90% likely to be located by x-ray vision scanning. Even though this ring enables its wearer to scan secret doors, traps, hidden items, and the like, it also limits his use of the power, for it drains 1 point of Constitution if used more frequently than once every six turns. If it is used three turns in one hour, the user loses 2 points from his total Constitution score, 3 if used four turns, etc.

This Constitution loss is recovered at the rate of 2 points per day of rest. If Constitution reaches 2, the wearer is exhausted and must test immediately, No activity, not even walking, can be performed until Constitution returns to 3 or better.

== Rods ==
Rods are about three feet long and as thick as your thumb. They are normally found in cases or similar storage places. Rods can be fashioned from metal, wood, ivory, or bone. They can be plain or decorated and carved, tipped or not.

Rods are powered by charges, unless noted otherwise in the description of a particular rod. Each time the rod is used, one or more charge may be expended. Characters do not automatically know the number of charges possessed by an item when it is discovered, although research and spellcasting can reveal this.

A rod can sometimes be recharged according to the rules given for constructing magical items if its charges have not totally been used up. When a rod is drained of all charges, it loses all its magical properties and cannot be recharged ever again.

When discovered, a rod normally contains 41 to SO (1d10 + 40) charges. However, while rods almost never have more charges than this, it is possible to find a rod with significantly fewer charges, particularly if it is captured from an enemy who has previously used the item.

=== Command Words (Optional Rule) ===
A rod is normally activated when the wielder utters a specific command word. This word acts like a trigger, unleashing the power stored within the item. Since control of a rod depends on knowledge of the command word, these are jealously guarded by the owner. An absent-minded wizard can etch the command word on the item or carry it on a piece of paper in his pocket, but this is only rarely done. Most often the character must use spells of the divination school or sages to discover the correct command to activate a rod.

=== List of Rods ===
'''Rod of Absorption:''' This rod acts as a magnet, drawing magic spells of any nature (priest or wizard) into itself. It then nullifies their effects and stores their potential until the wielder releases this energy in the form of spells of his own casting. The magic absorbed must have been directed at the character possessing the rod. The wielder can instantly detect a spell’s level as the rod absorbs the spell’s energy.

A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. For example, a rod that absorbs a 6th-level spell and a 3rd-level spell has a total of nine absorbed levels. The wielder of the without loss of spell memory. The only restriction is that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast. Continuing the example above, the rod-wielder could cast a maximum of one 9th-level spell, one 6th-level and one 3rd-level, and so on,

The ''rod of absorption'' can never be recharged. It absorbs 50 spell levels and can thereafter only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The wielder will know that the rod’s limit has been reached upon grasping the item. Used charges indicate that it has already absorbed some of its maximum of 50 spell levels and that some of those have been used.

Here is a more specific example: A priest uses a ''rod of absorption'' to nullify the effect of a hold person spell cast at him by a mage. The rod has now absorbed three spell levels and can absorb 47 more. The cleric can cast any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell he has memorized, without memory loss of that spell, by using the stored potential of the rod. Assume the cleric casts a ''hold person'' back. This spell is only 2nd-level to him, so the rod still holds one spell level of potential, can absorb 47 more, and has disposed of two charges permanently.

'''Rod of Alertness:''' This magical rod is indistinguishable from a ''footman’s mace +1''. It has eight flanges on its macelike head. The rod bestows +1 to the possessor’s die rolls for being surprised, and in combat the possessor gains
-1 on initiative die rolls. If it is grasped firmly, the rod enables the character to ''detect alignment'', ''evil'', ''good'', ''illusions'', ''invisibility'', ''lie'', or ''magic''. The use of these detect powers does not expend any of the charges in the rod.

If the ''rod of alertness'' is planted in the ground, and the possessor wills it to alertness, the rod will “sense” any creature within a 120- foot radius, provided the creature intends to harm the possessor. Each of the flanges on the
rod’s head then cast a ''light'' spell along one of the main directions (N, NE, E, etc.) out to a 60- foot range. At the same time, the rod creates the effect of a ''prayer'' spell upon all creatures friendly to the possessor in a 20-foot radius. Immediately thereafter, the rod sends forth a mental alert to these friendly creatures, warning them of possible danger from the unfriendly creature(s) within the 120-foot radius.

Lastly, the rod can be used to simulate the casting of an ''animate object'' spell, utilizing any 16 (or fewer) objects specially designated by the possessor and placed roughly around the perimeter of a 6-foot-radius circle centered on the rod. The selected objects can be 16 shrubs, 16 specially shaped branches, or whatever. All of the rod’s protective functions require one charge. The ''animate object'' power require one additional charge, so, if all of the rod’s protective devices are utilized at once, two charges are expended.

The rod can be recharged by a priest of 16th level or higher, as long as at least one charge remains in the rod when the recharging is attempted.

'''Rod of Beguiling:''' This rod enables its possessor to radiate an emotional and mental wave of fellow feeling to all creatures with any Intelligence whatsoever (1 or higher Intelligence). The rod causes all such creatures within a 20-foot radius of the device to regard the wielder as their comrade, friend, or mentor (no saving throw),

The beguiled creatures will love and respect the rod wielder. They will listen, trust, and obey him, insofar as communication is possible and instructions given don’t consign the beguiled to needless injury or destruction or go against their nature or alignment. Each charge of the rod beguiles for one turn. It can be recharged.

'''Rod of Cancellation:''' This dreaded rod is a bane to all classes, for its touch drains items of all magical properties unless a saving throw versus the cancellation is made. Contact is made by making a normal attack roll in melee combat.

&#42; Several small items, such as magical arrows or bolts together in one container, will be drained simultaneously.

To find out if the draining can be prevented, a d20 roll must be made for the target item. If the die roll results in a number equal to or higher than the number listed on the table above, the target is unaffected. If the roll is lower, the item is drained. Upon draining an item, the rod itself becomes brittle and cannot be used again. Drained items are not restorable, even by ''wish''.

'''Rod of Flailing:''' This magical weapon radiates faintly of alteration magic when subjected to a ''detect magic'' spell. Upon the command of its possessor, the weapon activates, changing from a normal-seeming rod to a doubleheaded flail. In close quarters, or if the wielder is mounted, it is the small, horseman’s weapon (base damage 1d4 +1, S-M/L); otherwise, it is a footman’s weapon (base damage 1d6+1/ 2d4, S-M/L).

In either form, the weapon has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls. Each of the weapon’s two heads can be used to attack, so double hits can be scored, either on a single opponent or on two opponents who are man-sized or smaller and standing side by side.

If the holder of the rod expends one charge, he gains +4 bonuses on Armor Class and saving throws for one turn. The rod need not be in weapon-form for this protection benefit to be employed. Transforming it into a weapon (or back into a rod) does not expend any charges.

'''Rod of Lordly Might:''' This rod has functions that are spell-like, but it can also be used as magic weapons of various sorts. It also has several more mundane uses. The ''rod of lordly might'' is metal, thicker than other rods, with a flanged ball at one end and various studs along its length. It weighs 10 pounds, thus requiring 16 or greater Strength to wield properly (-1 penalty to attack rolls for each point of Strength below 16).

The spell-like functions of the rod are:
* ''Paralyzation'' upon touch, if the wielder so commands
* ''Fear'' upon all enemies viewing it, if the wielder so desires (6-foot maximum range)
* ''Drain'' 2d4 hit points from a touched opponent and bestow them upon the rod wielder, up to the rod wielder’s normal maximum.
:Each such function draws off one charge from the rod. The functions entitle victims to saving throws vs. spell, with the exception of the draining function above—this requires a successful hit during melee combat.

The weapon uses of the rod do not use charges. These are:
* ''mace +2''
* ''sword of flame +1'' when button #1 is pushed. A blade springs from the ball; the ball becomes the sword’s hilt. The weapon shortens to an overall length of three feet.
* ''battle axe +4'' when button #2 is pushed. Again, a blade springs forth at the ball, and the whole lengthens to a length of four eet.
* ''spear +3'' when button #3 is pushed. The sword blade springs forth, and the handle can be lengthened up to 12 feet, for an overall length of from 6 feet to 15 feet. In 15-foot length, the rod is suitable for use as a lance,

The mundane uses of the rod do not use charges. These are:
* ''Climbing pole''. When button #4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in granite is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens5 to 50 feet in a single round, stopping when button #4 is pushed. Horizontal bars three inches long fold out from the sides, one foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by spike and hooks and will bear up to 4,000 pounds weight. It retracts by pushing button #5.
* The ladder function can also be used to force open doors, The rod’s base is planted 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and is in line with it. The force exerted is equal to storm giant Strength.
* When button #6 is pushed, the rod will indicate magnetic north and give the possessor a knowledge of his approximate depth beneath the surface (or height above it).

The ''rod of lordly might'' cannot be recharged. When its charges are exhausted, spelllike functions cease, as do all weapon functions except the ''mace +2''. The rod continues to work in all other ways.

'''Rod of Passage:''' This potent item allows its wielder to perform any of the following, one at a time, one per round: ''astral travel'', ''dimension door'', ''passwall'', ''phase door'', and ''teleport without error''. It is necessary to expend one charge to activate the rod, but once it is activated the possessor can perform each of the listed functions one time. The rod remains charged for one day, or until each of the five functions is used. None of the functions can be used a second time unless another charge is expended, whereupon all five of the functions again become available.

With respect to ''astral travel'', the wielder can elect to use the rod on as many as five creatures (one of which must be the wielder hirnself), Each creature then takes on astral form and can travel in that form. Any remaining functions of the rod are cancelled by this action, The rod travels into the Astral plane along with the wielder and the other affected creatures, and cannot be used or reactivated until it is returned from the Astral plane.

This five-in-one effect doesn’t work with respect to the rod''s other powers; only ''astral travel'' can be used more than once per activation, and only in the manner described above.

The rod exudes a magical aura of the alteration and evocation sort. Because the physical bodies of the travelers, and their possessions, are actually empowered to become astral, the recharging of the rod requires a wizard of 20th level or higher.

'''Rod of Resurrection:''' This rod enables a cleric to resurrect the dead—even elven, dwarven, gnome, or halfling—as if he were of high enough level to cast the ''resurrection'' spell. No rest is required, as the rod bestows the life giving effects.

The rod can be used once per day. The number of charges used to resurrect a character depends on class and race. Total the number of charges indicated for the character’s class and race:

Multi-classed characters use the least favorable category. The rod cannot be recharged.

'''Rod of Rulership:''' The individual who possesses this magic rod is able to command the obedience and fealty of creatures within 120 feet when he or she activates the device. From 200 to 500 Hit Dice (or levels of experience) can be ruled, but creatures with 15 or greater Intelligence and 12 or more Hit Dice/levels are entitled toa saving throw vs. spell. Ruled creatures will obey the wielder of the ''rod of rulership'' as if he or she were their absolute sovereign. Still, if the wielder gives a command that is absolutely contrary to the nature of the creatures commanded, the magic will be broken. The rod has a casting time of 5. Each charge lasts for one turn. The rod cannot be recharged.

'''Rod of Security:''' Each time a charge is expended, this item creates a non-dimensional space, a “pocket paradise.” There the rod’s possessor and as many as 199 other creatures can stay in complete safety for a period of time, the maximum being 200 days divided by the number of creatures affected. Thus, one creature (the rod’s possessor) can stay for 200 days; four creatures can stay for 50 days; a group of 60 creatures can stay for three days. All fractions are rounded down, so that group numbering between 101 and 200 inclusive can stay for one day only.

In this “paradise,” creatures don’t age (except from magical causes such as the casting of a ''wish'' spell), and natural healing and curing take place at twice the normal rate. Fresh water and food (fruits and vegetables only) are in abundance. The climate is comfortable for all creatures involved, so that protection from the elements is not necessary.

Activation of the rod causes the wielder and as many creatures as were touched with the item at the time of use to be transported instantaneously to the paradise. (Members of large groups can hold hands or otherwise touch each other, allowing all to be “touched” by the rod at once.)

When the rod’s effect is cancelled or expires, all of the affected creatures instantly reappear in the location they occupied when the rod was activated. If something else occupies the space that a traveler would be returning to, then his body is displaced a sufficient distance to provide the space required for “re-entry.”

The rod can be recharged by the joint efforts of a priest of 16th or higher level and a wizard of 18th or higher level.

'''Rod of Smiting:''' This rod is a +3 magical weapon that inflicts 1d8 +3 points of damage. Against golems, the rod causes 2d8+6 points of damage, and any score of 20 or better completely destroys the golem. Any hit upon a golem drains one charge.

The rod causes normal damage (1d8+3)
versus creatures of the outer planes. Any score of 20 or better draws off one charge and causes triple damage: (1d8 + 3) x 3. The rod cannot be recharged.

'''Rod of Splendor:''' The possessor of this rod is automatically and continually bestowed with a Charisma of 18 for as long as the item is held or carried. Whatever garments the possessor wears (including armor) appear to be of the finest quality and condition, although no special magical benefit (such as a change in Armor Class) is enjoyed.

If the possessor already has a Charisma score of 18 or greater, the rod does not further enhance this attribute. When the possessor expends one charge, the rod actually creates and garbs him in clothing of the finest fabrics, plus adornments of furs and jewels.

Apparell created by the magic of the rod remains in existence unless the possessor attempts to sell any part of it, or if any of the garb is forcibly taken from him. In either of these cases, all of the apparel immediately disappears. The garments may be freely given to other characters or creatures, however, and will remain whole and sound afterward. Characters bedecked in a magically created outfit
can’t replace or add garments by expending another charge—if the possessor tries this, the charge is simply wasted.

The value of any noble garb created by the wand will be from 7,000 to 10,000 gp (1d4 +
6). The fabric will be worth 1,000 gp, furs 5,000 gp, and jewel trim trom 1,000 to 4,000 gp (i.e,, 10 gems of 100 gp value each, 10 gems of 200 gp value each or 20 gems of 100 gp value, and so forth).

The second special power of the rod, also requiring one charge to bring about, is the creation of a palatial tent—a huge pavilion of silk encompassing between 1,500 and 3,000 square feet. Inside the tent are temporary furnishings and food suitable to the splendor of the pavilion and in sufficient supply to entertain as many as 100 persons.

The tent and its trappings will last for one day, At the end of that time, the pavilion may be maintained by expending another charge. If the extra charge isn’t spent, the tent and all objects associated with it (including any items that were taken out of the tent) disappear. This rod cannot be recharged.

'''Rod of Terror:''' This rod is a +2 magical weapon capable of inflicting 1d6 +3 points of damage per hit. Furthermore, the wielder can expend a charge to envelop himself in a terrifying aura. His clothes and appearance are transformed into an illusion of darkest horror, such that all within 30 feet who view him must roll successful saving throws vs. rods or be struck motionless with terror. Those who succeed on their save suffer a — 1 penalty to their morales and must make immediate morale checks. However, each time the rod is used, there is a 20% chance the wielder will permanently lose 1 point from his Charisma score.

== Staves ==
Staves are about 5 feet or 6 feet long and as thick as a young sapling —about an inch and a half at the base, tapering to an inch at the tip, although they can be of nearly equal diameter throughout. Staves are typically fashioned of wood, often carved, usually metal bound, and likely to be gnarly and twisted. They can be unusual or appear to be ordinary.

Staves, like wands and rods, are powered by charges. A stave typically has 1d6+19 charges when found. Again, it is possible for a stave to have fewer charges, although almost none have more than this number. Some staves can be recharged according to the rules for making magical items. Once all the charges are used, the stave is rendered nonmagical and cannot be recharged.

Unless inapplicable or otherwise specified, staves function at the 8th level of magic use. Their spell discharge is that of an 8th-level wizard with respect to range, duration, area of effect.

Damage is nominally 8d6 with respect to fireballs, lightning bolts, etc.

=== Command Word (Optional Rule) ===
If the DM desires, unleashing the power of a stave can require a specific command word or phrase that must be discovered or researched separately from the item itself. This command can be as simple as a single word (“Heal”) or could be as complicated as a rhyming phrase that must be adjusted to fit the circumstances (“I touch this elf; resoter his health,”, or “In tis moment of great toil, I command thee, staff—uncoil!”). Since command words are the key to great power, wise owners will memorize them and destroy all other evidence. Indeed, knowledge of command words can be used as a bargaining point in surrender or negotiations.

=== List of Staves ===
'''Staff-Mace:''' This clerical weapon appears to be a normal wooden staff of the type used when trekking in the wilderness. This item is typically made of bronzewood, reinforced by heavy bands and tips of iron. It gives off a very faint aura of alteration magic. Upon command, the ''staff-mace'' takes on one of three forms, as desired by the possessor:

Quarterstaff: quarterstaff +3, iron-shod<br/>
Great Mace: footman’s mace +1, iron<br/>
Mace: horseman’s mace +2, iron

'''Staff-Spear:''' When this seemingly ordinary quarterstaff is examined magically, it will have an aura of alteration, Upon proper command, a long and sharp spear blade will shoot forth from its upper end, This makes the weapon into a spear rather than a staff. Upon a second command, the length of the weapon will elongate to a full 12 feet, and the third command will recall it to its original form. The powers and value of each staff-spear are determined randomly when the item is first employed:

&#42; Does damage as ranseur (2d4), but still acts as a spear if used to thrust or when set to receive a charge.

'''Staff of Command:''' This device has three functions, only two of which will be effective if the wielder is a wizard; all three work when the staff is in a priest’s hands. The three functions are:

''Human influence:'' This power duplicates that of the ring of the same name. Each ''suggestion'' or ''charm'' draws one charge from the staff,

''Mammal control/animal control:'' This power functions only as ''mammal control'' (as the ring of that name) when the staff is used by a wizard. In the hands of a priest it is a staff of ''animal control'' (as the potion of that name, all types of animals listed). Either use drains one charge per turn or fraction thereof.

''Plant control:'' This function duplicates that of the potion of the same name, but for each 10-square-foot area of plants controlled for one turn or less, one charge is used, A wizard cannot control plants at all.

The staff can be recharged.

'''Staff of Curing:''' This device can ''cure disease'', ''cure blindness'', ''cure wounds'' (3d6 +3 hit points), or'' cure insanity'', Each function drains one charge. The device can be used once per day on any person (dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, halfling included), and no function may be employed more than twice per day (i,e., the staff can function only eight times during a 24-hour period). It can be recharged.

'''Staff of the Magi:''' This potent staff contains many spell powers and other functions. Some of its powers drain charges; others don’t. The following powers do not drain charges:
* ''detect magic''
* ''enlarge''
* ''hold portal''
* ''light''
* ''protection from evil/good''

The following powers drain one charge per usage:
* ''invisibility''
* ''fireball''
* ''knock''
* ''lightning bolt''
* ''pyrotechnics''
* ''ice storm''
* ''web''
* ''wall of fire''
* ''dispel magic''
* ''passwall''

These powers drain two charges per usage:
* ''whirlwind*''
* ''conjure elemental**''
* ''plane travel''
* ''teiekinesis***''
&#42; The whirlwind is identical to that caused by a djinni.<br/>
&#42;&#42; The staff can be used to conjure one elemental of each type per day, each having 8 Hit Dice.<br/>
&#42;&#42;&#42; Telekinesis is at 8th level also (i.e., 200 pounds maximum weight).

The ''staff of the magi'' adds a +2 bonus to all saving throw rolls vs. spell. [t can be usedto absorb wizard spell energy directed at its wielder, but if the staff absorbs its charge limit, it will explode as if a “retributive strike” (see below) had been made. The spell levels of energy absorbed count only as recharging the staff, but they cannot be redirected immediately, so if absorption is desired, that is the only action possible by the staff wielder that round, Note also that the wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at him, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a ''rod of absorption'' does. Absorbing spells is risky, but absorption is the only way this staff can be recharged.

Retributive strike is a breaking of the staff. It must be purposeful and declared by the wizard wielding it. When this is done all levels of spell energy in the staff are released in a globe of 30- foot radius, All creatures within 10 feet of the broken staff suffer hit points of damage equal to eight times the number of spell levels of energy in the rod (1 to 25), those between 10 feet- 20 feet take6 * levels, and those 20 feet-30 feet distant take 4 * levels. Successful saving throws versus magic indicate only one-half damage is sustained,

The wizard breaking the staff has a 50%
chance of traveling to another plane of existence, but if he does not, the explosive release of spell energy totally destroys him. This staff and the staff of power are the only magical items capable of a retributive strike.

'''Staff of Power:''' The staff of power is a very potent magical item, with offensive and defensive abilities. The powers below cost one charge each:
* ''continual light''
* ''magic missile'' or ''lightning bolt''
* ''darkness, 5’ radius''
* ''ray of enfeeblement''
* ''levitation''
* ''cone of cold'' or ''fireball''

The following powers drain two charges each:
* ''shield, 5’ radius''
* ''globe of invulnerability''
* ''paralyzation*''
&#42; Paralyzation is a ray from the end of the staff extending in a cone 40 feet long and 20 feet wide at the far end.

The DM may assign alternate powers by random die roll.

The wielder of a ''staff of power'' gains a +2 bonus Armor Class and saving throws, He may use the staff to smite opponents. It strikes as a +2 magical weapon and inflicts 1d6+2 points of damage; if one charge is expended, the staff causes double damage, but two charges do not cause triple damage.

A ''staff of power'' can be broken for a retributive strike (see ''staff of the magi''). The staff can be recharged.

'''Staff of the Serpent:''' There are two varieties of this staff—the “python” and the “adder.”

The python strikesas a +2 magical weapon and inflicts 1d6 + 2 points of damage when it hits. If the priest throws the staff to the ground, it grows from its 6-foot length, becominga constrictor snake, 25 feet long (AC 3, 49 hit points, movement rate of 9), This happens in one round. The snake will entwine if it scores a hit, the opponent being constricted for 2d4 +2 points of damage per round. The victim will remain trapped by the python until he dies or the creature is destroyed. Note that the python will return to its owner upon command. If it is destroyed while in snake form, the staff is destroyed.

The adder strikes as a +1 magical weapon and does 2d2 points of damage when it hits. Upon command the head of the staff becomes that of an actual serpent (AC 5, 20 hit points). This head remains for one full turn. When a hit is scored, damage is not increased, but the victim must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison (strength E) or be slain. Only evil priests will employ an adder staff. If the snake head is killed, the staff is destroyed.

Neither staff has nor requires charges. Most of these staves—60% —are pythons.

'''Staff of Slinging:''' This magical quarterstaff appears to be a +1 weapon unless it is grasped by a druid, whereupon its power of slinging becomes evident. This power, which can be employed ''only'' by a druid, is activated when one end of the staff is touched to a heavy object of roughly spherical shape (a stone, metal ball, pottery crock, etc.) of up to nine inches in diameter and five pounds in weight. The object adheres to the end of the staff, and the wielder need then only swing the staff in an overhand arc to release the missile toward a desired target.

The missile leaves the staff on the downstroke of the overhand swing and travels in a low, rising trajectory, with the missile going one foot upward for every 10 feet traveled. Of course, the arc may be higher, or the missile aimed so as to travel nearly vertically. (In the latter case, reverse the arcing ratio so that one toot of distance laterally is covered for every 10 teet of vertical rise.) The maximum range of such a missile is 180 feet, with limits of 60 feet and 120 feet on short and medium range, respectively.

This staff also carries charges, and a druid wielding the item can expend one charge and thereby use the staff to hur! a missile of large size, as if the wielder were a stone giant (range out to 300 feet, 3d.10 points of damage per hit). Whether used as a magical quarterstaff or by employing one of its slinging powers, the staff bestows +1 to the wielder’s attack roll and +1 per die to damage dealt out. The weapon may be recharged by a druid of 12th or higher level.

'''Staff of Striking:''' This oaken staff is the equivalent of a +3 magical weapon. (If the weapon vs. armor type adjustment is used, the ''staff of striking'' is treated as the most favorable weapon type vs. any armor.) It causes 1d6+3 points of damage when a hit is scored, This expends a charge. If two charges are expended, bonus damage is doubled (1d6 +6): if three charges are expended, bonus damage is tripled (1d6 +9), No more than three charges can be expended per strike. The staff can be recharged.

'''Staff of Swarming Insects:''' A staff of this sort is typically short and thick. When initially obtained or encountered, much of its length is covered with finely done carvings depicting winged biting and stinging insects (bees, deerflies, horseflies, wasps, and the like), Any priest character (cleric, druid, shaman, witch doctor, etc.) holding it can command the staff to create a swarm of such insects, at the same time expending one of the staff’s charges.

Range is 60 yards +10 yards per level of the user, The number of insects produced is 60 plus 10 per level. Every 10 insects wil) inflict 1 point of damage upon the target victim, regardless of Armor Class, unless the victim is protected by a ''force field'', engulfed in flames, etc. Note, however, that the insects will not affect creatures larger than man-sized with a natural Armor Class of 5 or better.

When a vulnerable target is attacked by the swarm of flying insects, the target will be unable to do anything other than attempt to dislodge and kill the things. The insect attack lasts for one round, Each time the staff is employed, one of the insect-shapes carved into its wooden surtace will disappear, so jt is easy to determine how many charges are left in the staff, Unlike others of its ilk, a staff of this sort can have as many as 50 initial charges. However, it cannot be recharged.

'''Staff of Thunder & Lightning:''' Casual examination of this stout quarterstaff will show it to be exceptional, and if it is magically examined, it will radiate an aura of alteration magic. Constructed of wood (ash, oak, bronzewood, or the like) and bound with iron set with silver rivets, it has the properties of a +2 magical weapon without any expenditure of its magical charges. Its other magical properties are as follows:

''Thunder:'' The staff strikes as a +3 weapon, and unless the opponent struck saves successfully vs. rods, staves, and wands, he will be ''stunned'' from the noise of the staff’s impact—
unable to take any further action in the round struck, and automatically having last initiative in the following round, This power requires the expenditure of one charge.

''Lightning:'' A short spark of electricity leaps forth when the opponent is struck, causing normal staff damage, plus 2d6 additional points of damage from shock. Note that the staff might not score a hit, but the electrical discharge discounts any form of metal armor (making the target effectively AC 10 for this purpose), so only such damage might apply. This power requires the expenditure of one charge.

''Thunderclap:'' The staff sends forth a cone of deafening noise, 5 feet wide at the apex, 40 feet long, and 20 feet wide at a point farthest from the source. All creatures within this cone, wholly or partially, must roll a successful saving throw vs. reds, staves, and wands or be ''stunned'' for 1d2 rounds (unable to attack during this time) and unable to hear for 1d2 additional rounds. Those who save are unable to hear for 1d4 rounds, but suffer no loss of attacks, This function requires the expenditure of two charges.

''Lightning Stroke:'' A bolt similar to that trom a ''wand of lightning'' is generated, but it is ot 8d6 strength, causing 16-48 points of damage (rolls of 1 are counted as 2) to those who fail a saving throw. The stroke can be single or forked. This function of the rod uses two charges.

''Thunder & Lightning:'' This power combines the ''thunderclap''. described above, with a forked lightning bolt as in the ''lightning stroke''. Damage from the lightning is a total of 8d6 with rolls of 1 or 2 counted as rolls of 3, for a range of 24-48 points. A saving throw applies, with deafness and half damage suffered by those who are successful. This power requires the expenditure of four charges.

The casting time required for any function is equal to the number of charges expended; thus, the ''thunder & lightning'' function costs four charges and has an initiative modifier of +4,

'''Staff of Withering:''' The ''staff of withering'' is a +1 magical weapon. A hit from it causes 1d4+1 points of damage. If two charges are expended when a hit is scored, the creature struck also ages 10 years, its abilities and lifespan adjusted for the resulting age increase. If three charges are expended when a hit is made, one of the opponent creature’s limbs can be made to shrivel and become useless unless it successfully saves vs. spell (check by random number generation for which limb is struck),

Ageless creatures (undead, demons, devils, etc.) cannot be aged or withered. Each effect of the staff is cumulative, so that three charges will score damage, age, and wither. Aging a dwarf is of little effect, while aging a dragon could actually aid the creature,

'''Staff of the Woodlands:''' This sort of staff is always made from oak, ash, or yew, finely grained, beautifully carved, and bound with bronze. It is effective only in the hands of g druid, Each such staff has the following powers, with each expending one charge per use:
* ''Wall of thorns''
* ''Animal friendship'' plus ''speak with animals''
* ''Animate tree*''
&#42; This function duplicates the ability of a treant to cause a large tree to move at a movement rate of 3 and attack as if it were a largestsized treant, and in all other respects becoming a virtual treant for eight rounds per charge expended. Note that one round is required for the tree to animate, and it will return to rooting on the eighth, so only six of the initial eight rounds are effectively available for attack tunction.

In addition to these powers, each ''staff of the woodlands'' has a magical weapon value. Those with a lesser value have extra magical powers that do not require charges and can be employed once per day: The +4 staff has no additional powers; the +3 staff also confers the power of ''pass without trace'': the +2 staff confers the powers of ''pass without trace'' and barkskin; the +1 staff confers the powers of the +2 staff plus the power of the ''tree'' spell. To determine which sort of staff has been discovered, assign even chances for each of the four types.

== Wands ==
Wands are 1¼ feet long and slender. They are made of ivory, bone, or wood and are usually tipped with something—metal, crystal, stone, etc. They are fragile and tend to break easily. Because of this, they are often kept in cases.

Wands perform at 6th level of experience with respect to the damage they cause, range, duration, area of effect, etc., unless otherwise stated.

At the DMs option, 1% of all wands can be trapped to backfire.

Wands are powered by charges, each use costing one or more charges (depending on the item). When discovered, a wand typically contains 1d20+80 charges. Captured wands taken from a defeated foe often have many fewer charges. Wands never have a greater number of charges than those listed. Most wands can be recharged according to the rules to making magical items.

When a wand runs out of charges, it can no longer be recharged. Furthermore, the DM can rule that the wand immediately crumbles into useless dust (settling the issue) or is now a useless, nonmagical stick.

=== Command Words (Optional Rules) ===
Like rods and staves, wands can require the utterance og a command word (or phrase) to operate, and like these other items, the key is seldom found in the lock. The DM can rule that the command word etched in magical writing on the wand (requiring a ''read magic'' to translate) or he can make the characters resort to such methods as ''commune'' spells and expesive sages. If you choose not to use this option, ignore references to command words in the item descriptions below—all items simply work.

=== List of Wands ===
'''Wand of Conjuration:''' Grasping this device enables a wizard to recognize any cast or written conjuration/summoning spell (''unseen servant'', ''monster summoning'', ''conjure elemental'', ''death spell'', ''invisible stalker'', ''limited wish'', ''symbol'', ''maze'', ''gate'', ''prismatic sphere'', ''wish''). The wand also has the following powers, which require expenditure of one charge each:
* ''unseen servant''
* ''monster summoning*''

&#42; A maximum of six charges may be expended, one per level of the ''monster summoning'', or ''six monster summoning I'', ''three monster summoning II'', ''two monster summoning III'', or any combination totaling six. The wizard must be of a sufficient experience level to cast the appropriate ''summoning'' spell.

The ''wand of conjuration'' can also conjure up a ''curtain of blackness''—a veil of total black that absorbs all light. The ''curtain of blackness'' can cover a maximum area of 600 square feet (60’ × 10’, 40’ × 15’, 30’ × 20’), but it must stretch from ceiling to floor, wall to wall. The ''curtain'' takes two charges to conjure. The veil of total lightlessness can be penetrated only by physical means or magic.

The wand also enables its wielder to construct a ''prismatic sphere'' (or ''wall''), one color at atime, red to violet, at a cost of one charge per color.

Each function of the wand has an initiative modifier of +5, and only one function per round is possible. The wand may be recharged.

'''Wand of Earth and Stone:''' A wand of this sort is typically short and tipped with some form of mineral. It is imbued with the following powers:
{| class="wikitable"
	| ''Dig''
	| ½ charge/use
	|-
	| ''Passwall''
	| one charge/use
	|-
	| ''Move earth''
	| two charges/use
|}
In addition, 50% of all such wands have the following powers:
{| class="wikitable"
	| ''Transmute mud to rock''
	| one charge/use
	|-
	| ''Transmute rock to mud''
	| one charge/use
|}

'''Wand of Enemy Detection:''' This wand pulses in the wielder’s hand and points in the direction of any creature(s) hostile to the bearer of the device, The creature(s) can be invisible, ethereal, astral, out of phase, hidden, disguised, or in plain sight. Detection range is a 60’ sphere. The function requires one charge to operate for one turn. The wand can be recharged.

'''Wand of Fear:''' When the ''fear'' wand is activated, a pale amber ray springs from the tip of the wand, forming a cone 60’ long by 20’ in base diameter, which flashes on and instantly disappears. Each creature touched by the ray must roll a successful saving throw vs. wand or react as per the ''cause fear'' spell (1st-level priest spell, ''remove fear'' reversal). In other words, creatures affected by the wand turn and move at fastest possible speed away from the wielder for six rounds, Each use costs one charge, lt can operate just once per round. The wand can be recharged.

'''Wand of Fire:''' This wand can function like the following wizard spells:
* ''Burning hands:'' The wand emits a fanshaped sheet of fire 10’ wide at its end and 12’ long. Each creature touched suffers six points of damage. The sheet of fire appears instantly, shoots forth dark red flames, and snuffs out in less than one second. It expends one charge.
* ''Pyrotechnics:'' This function duplicates the spell of the same name. It has an initiative modifier of +2 and expends one charge.
* ''Fireball:'' The wand coughs forth a peasized sphere that streaks out to the desired range (to a maximum of 160’) and bursts in a fiery, violet-red blast, just like the fireball spell. The initiative modifier is +2, and this expends two charges. The fireball inflicts 6d6 points of damage, but all 1s rolled are counted as 2s (i.e., the burst causes 12-36 points). A saving throw vs. wand is applicable.
* ''Wall of fire:'' The wand can be used to draw a fiery curtain of purplish-red flames 1200 feet square (10’ × 120’, 20’ × 60’, 30’ × 40’, etc.). The flames last for six rounds and cause 2d6 +6 points damage if touched (2d4 points if within 10° of the fire, 1d4 if within 20’). The flames can also be shaped into a ring around the wand user (but the circle is 25‘ in diameter), The initiative modifier is +3, and its use expends two charges.

The ''wand of fire'' can operate just once per round. It can be recharged.

'''Wand of Flame Extinguishing:''' This sort of wand has three separate functions:

Nonmagical fires of normal size can be extinguished without using any charges. Normal size includes anything up to the size of a bontire or a fire in a regular fireplace—equal to four to six billets of wood burning hotly.

To extinguish large, nonmagical fires, flaming oil in quantity equal to a gallon or more, the fire produced by a fiend, a ''flame tongue sword'', or a ''burning hands'' spell, one charge is expended from the wand. Continual magical flames, such as those of a sword or a creature able to ignite, will be extinguished for six rounds and will flare up again after that time.

When applied to large magical fires such as those caused by ''fireball'', ''flame strike'', or ''wall of fire'' spells, two charges are expended from the wand as the flames are extinguished.

If the device is used upon a creature composed of flame (a fire elemental, for instance), a successful attack roll inflicts 6d6 points of damage upon the creature.

'''Wand of Frost:''' A ''frost'' wand can perform three functions that duplicate wizard spells:
* ''Ice storm:'' A silvery ray springs forth from the wand and an ice (or sleet) storm occurs up to 60’ away from the wand holder, This function requires one charge.
* ''Wall of ice:'' The silvery ray forms a wall of ice, six inches thick, covering a 600-square-foot area (10’ × 60’, 20’ × 30’, etc.). Its initiative modifier is +2, and it uses one charge.
* ''Cone of cold:'' White crystalline motes spray forth from the wand in a cone with a 60’ length and a terminal diameter of 20’. The initiative modifier is +2, and the effect lasts just one second. The temperature is -100 F., and is odd, treating all 1s rolled as 2s (6d6, 12-36). The cost is two charges per use. Saving throw vs. wands is applicable.

The wand can function once per round, and may be recharged.

'''Wand of Illumination:''' This wand has four separate functions, three of which approximate wizard spells, and one of which is unique:
* ''Dancing lights:'' The wand produces this effect at a cost of one charge.
* ''Light:'' The ''illumination'' wand sends forth light at an expenditure of one charge.
* ''Continual light:'' This function requires two charges.
* ''Sunburst:'' When this effect is called forth, the wand delivers a sudden flash of brilliant, greenish-white light, with blazing golden rays. The range of this sunburst is 120 yards maximum, and its duration is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> of a second. Its area of effect is a globe of 40’ diameter, Any undead within this globe suffer 6d6 points of damage, with no saving throw. Creatures within or facing the burst must roll successful saving throws vs. wands or be blinded for one round and be unable to do anything during that period. (Of course, the creatures in question must have sight organs sensitive to the visible light spectrum). The function requires three charges.

The wand can be recharged.

'''Wand of Ilusion:''' This wand creates audible and visual illusions (see ''audible glamer''. ''phantasmal force''). The wand emits an invisible ray, with a 140-yard maximum range. The effect has an initiative modifier of +3. The wand wielder must concentrate on the illusion in order to maintain it—he may move normally but can’t melee during this time. Each portion, audible and visual, costs one charge to effect and one per round to continue. The wand may be recharged.

'''Wand of Lightning:''' This wand has two functions that closely resemble wizard spells:
* ''Shock:'' This does 1-10 hit points of damage to a target struck in melee combat, with no saving throw. Characters wearing metal armor and/or shields are treated as Armor Class 10, Plain leather and wood work normally. Magic bonuses on metal armor do not affect Armor Class, but a ''ring of protection'' does, The shock uses one charge.
* ''Lightning bolt:'' The possessor of the wand can discharge a bolt of lightning. The stroke can be either a forked or straight bolt (see wizard spell, ''lightning bolt''). Damage is 12-36 (6d6, treating 1s as 2s), but a saving throw is applicable. This function uses two charges and has an initiative modifier of +2.

The wand may be recharged. It can perform only one function per round.

'''Wand of Magic Detection:''' This wand is similar in operation to the ''enemy detection'' wand. If any form of magic is in operation, or a magical item exists within a 30’ radius, the ''magic detection'' wand will pulse and point to the strongest source. Note that the wand will point to a person upon whom a spell has been cast.

Operation requires one round, and successive rounds will point out successively less powerful magical radiations. The school of magic (abjuration, alteration, etc.) can be determined if one round is spent concentrating on the subject emanation, One charge is expended per turn (or fraction thereof) of use. Starting with the second round of continuous use, there is a 2% cumulative chance per round that the wand will temporarily malfunction and indicate nonmagical items as magical, or vice-versa. The wand may be recharged.

'''Wand of Magic Missiles:''' This wand discharges magic missiles similar to those of the 1st-level wizard spell of the same name. The missile causes 1d4+1 points of damage. It always hits its target when the wand is wielded by a wizard, otherwise an attack roll is required. The wand has an initiative modifier of +3, and each missile costs one charge. A maximum of two may be expended in one round. The wand may be recharged.

'''Wand of Metal and Mineral Detection:''' This wand has a 30’ radius range. It pulses in the wielder’s hand and points to the largest mass of metal within its effective area of operation. However. the wielder can concentrate on a specific metal or mineral (gold, platinum, quartz, beryl, diamond, corundum, etc.). If the specific mineral is within range, the wand will point to any and all places it is located, and the wand possessor will know the approximate quantity as well. Each operation requires one round. Each charge powers the wand for two full turns. The wand may be recharged.

'''Wand of Negation:''' This device negates the spell or spell-like function(s) of rods, staves, wands, and other magical items. The individual with the ''negation'' wand points the device, and a pale gray beam shoots forth to touch the target device or individual. This totally negates any wand function, and makes any other spell or spell-like function from a device 75% likely to be negated, regardless of the level or power of the spell. The wand can function once per round, and each negation drains one charge. The wand cannot be recharged.

'''Wand of Paralyzation:''' This wand shoots forth a thin ray of bluish color to a maximum range of 60’. Any creature touched by the ray must roll a successful saving throw vs. wand or be rendered rigidly immobile for 5d4 rounds. A save indicates the ray missed, and there is no effect. As soon as the ray touches one creature, it stops—the wand can attack only one target per round. The wand has an initiative modifier of +3, and each use costs one charge. The wand may operate once per round. It may be recharged.

'''Wand of Polymorphing:''' This wand emits a thin, green beam that darts forth to a maximum distance of 60 yards. Any creature touched by this beam must make a saving throw vs. wand (success indicating a miss) or be ''polymorphed'' (as the ''polymorph others'' spell). The wielder may opt to turn the victim into a snail, frog, insect, etc., as long as the result is a small and inoffensive creature.

The possessor of the wand may elect to touch a creature with the device instead, Unwilling creatures must be hit and are also entitled to a saving throw. If the touch is successful, the recipient is surrounded by dancing motes of sparkling emerald light, and then transforms into whatever creature-shape the wand wielder wants, This is the same magical effect as the ''polymorph self'' spell.

Either function has an initiative modifier of +3, Each draws one charge. Only one function per round is possible. The wand may be recharged.

'''Wand of Secret Door and Trap Location:''' This wand has an effective radius of 15’ for secret door location, 30° for trap location, When the wand is energized it will pulse in the wielder’s hand and point to all secret doors or traps within range. Note that it locates either doors or traps, not both during one operation. It requires one round to function and draws one charge. The wand may be recharged.

'''Wand of Size Alteration:''' A wand of thissort enables the wielder to cause any single creature of virtually any size to ''enlarge'' or ''diminish''. Either effect causes a 50% change in size.

Relative Strength and power increases or decreases proportionally, providing the weaponry employed is proportionate or usable, For humanoid creatures enlarged, Strength is roughly proportional to that of a giant of corresponding size, For example, a humanoid enlarged to 9" tall is roughly equivalent to a hill giant (19 Strength), a 13’ tall humanoid equals a fire giant (22 Strength).

The wand’s power has a range of 10’. The target creature and all it is wearing or carrying are affected unless a saving throw succeeds. Note that a willing target need not make a saving throw.

The effect of the wand can be removed by a ''dispel magic'' spell, but if this is done, the target must roll a system shock check. It can also be countered if the possessor of the wand wills the effect to be cancelled before the duration of the effect expires. Each usage of the wand (but not the cancellation of an effect) expends one charge. It can be recharged by a wizard of 12th or higher level.

'''Wand of Wonder:''' The wand of wonder is a strange and unpredictable device that will generate any number of strange eftects, randomly, each time it is used. The usual effects are shown on the table below, but you may alter these for any or all of these wands in your campaign as you see fit. Possible functions of the wand include:
{| class="wikitable"

|}

The wand uses one charge per function. It may not be recharged. Where applicable, saving throws should be made.

== Miscellaneous Magic ==
As the name implies, this category is a catch-all for many sorts of magical items. Some are powerful, others weak; some are highly desirable, others are deadly to the finder. The number of miscellaneous items is great enough that duplication of items in a campaign can be kept to a minimum.

Reveal information about items with care. Initially, describe an item only in the most general of terms: wood, metal, cloth, leather, etc. Allow players to ask questions about the look, feel, and smell of an item. Likewise, do not simply blurt out the properties and powers of an item. Items must be held, or worn, or manipulated before revealing their secrets. Bards, sages, identify spells, and so on may be the best (and easiest) determiners of magical qualities, but experimentation and experience are useful and make for good role-playing.

Items are listed alphabetically. Unless a description specifically restricts item use, or a leti58 ter representing a particular class follows a listing, items are usable by any class. Class letters are (C) clerics, (F) fighters, etc, and each listing includes appropriate sub-classes.

=== Categories of Magical Items ===
Most of the item descriptions below are complete in and of themselves. A few categories of magical items require some general comments, however:

'''Artifacts and Relics:''' These are not listed here, They are the DM’s province. Advice on the creation and use of artifacts and relics can be found beginning on page 89.

'''Books:''' All magical books, librams, manuals, tomes, etc, appear to be “normal” works of arcane lore. Each is indistinguishable from all others by visual examination of the outer parts or by detection for magic aura.

A wish spell can identify or classify a magical work. Other spells, notably ''alter reality'', ''commune'', ''contact higher planes'', ''limited wish'', and ''true seeing'' are useless. A ''wish'' reveals the general contents of a book, telling what classes or characteristics are most affected (not necessarily benefited) by the work, A second ''wish'' is required to determine the book’s exact contents.

After being perused by a character, most magical works vanish forever, but one which is non-beneficial to the reader may be attached to the character, and he will be unable to rid himself of it. If the work benefits another character alignment, the possessor is geased to conceal and guard it. As DM you should use your judgment and imagination as to exactly how these iterns will be treated, using the rules in this section as parameters.

'''Boots:''' All magical boots expand or shrink to fit the wearer, from halfling to giant size.

'''Eyes:''' Mixing eye types is certain to cause immediate insanity for 2d4 turns. Once this time has passed the character can (and should) remove one of the magical lenses!

'''Ropes:''' Any magical rope which s broken or severed immediately loses its special properties.

Note that though the miscellaneous magical iterns are broken into categories on the tables for the purpose of random selection, all items are alphabetized together in the following descriptions.

'''Alchemy Jug:''' This magical device can pour forth various liquids upon command, The quantity of each liquid is dependent upon the liquid itself. The jug can pour only one kind of liquid on any given day, seven pourings maximum. The liquids pourable and quantity per pouring are:
{| class="wikitable"
	| Salt water
	| 16 gallons
	|-
	| Fresh water
	| 8 gallons
	|-
	| Beer
	| 4 gallons
	|-
	| Vinegar
	| 2 gallons
	|-
	| Wine
	| 1 gallon
	|-
	| Ammonia
	| 1 quart
	|-
	| Oil
	| 1 pint
	|-
	| Aqua regia
	| 2 gills (8 oz.)
	|-
	| Alcohol
	| 1 gill (4 oz,)
	|-
	| Chlorine 8 drams (1 oz.)
	|-
	| Cyanide
	| 4 drams ("/2 oz.)
|}
The jug will pour forth two gallons per round, so it will require eight rounds to complete a pouring of salt water.

'''Amulet of Inescapable Location:''' This device is typically worn on a chain or as a brooch. It appears to be an amulet that prevents location, scrying (crystal ball viewing and the like), or detection or influence by ESP or telepathy. Actually, the amulet doubles the likelihood and/or range of these location and detection modes, Normal item identification attempts, including ''detect magic'', will not reveal its true nature.

'''Amulet of Life Protection:''' This pendant or brooch device serves as protection for the psyche. The wearer is protected from the ''magic jar'' spell or any similar mental attack that would usurp control of the wearer’s body. If the wearer is slain, the psyche enters the amulet and is protected for seven full days. Thereafter, it departs to the plane of its alignment. If the amulet is destroyed during the seven days, the psyche is utterly and irrevocably annihilated.

'''Amulet of the Planes:''' This device enables the individual possessing it to transport himself instantly to or from any one of the closest levels of the Outer Planes. This travel is absolutely safe, if not absolutely sure, but until the individual learns the device, transport will be random. Roll 1d6, On a 4-6, add 12 to the result of a 1d12 roll (for a result between 1 and 24). On a 1-3 = do not add 12 to a 1d12 roll. Figure the total and consult the following table to determine where the holder of the amulet ends up:
{| class="wikitable"
	| 1-2
	| Seven Heavens
	|-
	| 3
	| Twin Paradises
	|-
	| 4
	| Elysium
	|-
	| 5
	| Happy Hunting Grounds
	|-
	| 6-7
	| Olympus
	|-
	| 8
	| Gladsheim
	|-
	| 9
	| Limbo
	|-
	| 10
	| Pandemonium
	|-
	| 11-12
	| Abyss
	|-
	| 13
	| Tarterus
	|-
	| 14
	| Hades
	|-
	| 15
	| Gehenna
	|-
	| 16-17
	| Nine Hells

	| 18
	| Acheron
	|-
	| 19
	| Nirvana
	|-
	| 20
	| Arcadia
	|-
	| 21-24
	| Prime Material plane*
	|-
	|colspan="2"|&#42; As an alternative, you can substitute the following for totals between 22 and 24:
	|-
	| 22
	| Ethereal plane
	|-
	| 23
	| Astral plane
	|-
	| 24
	| Prime, but alternate Earth
|}

'''Amulet of Proof Against Detection and Location:''' This device protects the wearer against all divination and magical location and detection. The wearer cannot be detected through ''clairaudience'', ''clairvoyance'', ''ESP''. ''crystal balls'', or any other scrying devices, No aura is discernible on the wearer, and predictions cannot be made regarding him unless a powerful being is consulted.

'''Amulet Versus Undead:''' This prized charm is a specially blessed symbol that enables the wearer to turn undead like a cleric, The amulet appears ordinary, but glows brightly when presented strongly (i.e., as if it were a holy symbol) in the presence of undead. The success of the attempt to turn is determined by the power of the amulet—the strength of each amulet varies, and when one is discovered, its type is ascertained by rolling on the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
	! Dice Score
	! Effective Clerical Level of Amulet
	|-
	| 01-30
	| 5th
	|-
	| 31-55
	| 6th
	|-
	| 56-75
	| 7th
	|-
	| 76-90
	| 8th
	|-
	| 91-00
	| 9th
|}
The amulet must be worn at all times to remain effective. When it is not worn, it becomes inert, and will remain so for the first seven days after it is put on. Its value is a function of its strength: 200 XP value per effective cleric level.

'''Apparatus of Kwalish:''' When found, this item appears to be a large, sealed iron barrel, but it has a secret catch that opens a hatch in one end. Inside are 10 levers:
{| class="wikitable"
	| 1
	| Extend/retract legs and tail
	|-
	| 2
	| Uncover/cover forward porthole
	|-
	| 3
	| Uncover/cover side portholes
	|-
	| 4
	| Extend/retract pincers and feelers
	|-
	| 5
	| Snap pincers
	|-
	| 6
	| Forward/left or right
	|-
	| 7
	| Backward/left or right
	|-
	| 8
	| Open “eyes” with ''continual light'' inside/close “eyes”
	|-
	| 9
	| Raise (levitate)/sink
	|-
	| 10
	| Open/close hatch
|}

The apparatus moves forward at a speed of three, backward at six. Two pincers extend forward four feet and snap for 2d6 points of damage each if they hit a creature—25% chance, no reduction for armor, but Dexterity reduction applies. The device can operate in water up to 900 feet deep. It can hold two man-sized characters and enough air to operate for 1d4 +1 hours at maximum capacity. The apparatus is AC 0 and requires 100 points of damage to causea leak, 200 to stave in aside. When the device is operating it looks something like a giant lobster.

'''Bag of Beans:''' This bag, constructed of heavy cloth, is about two feet wide and four feet long (the size of any other large bag or sack). A character who opens it will find several large, pebble-like objects inside. If dumped out of the bag, these objects explode for 5d4 points of damage each. All creatures within a 10 foot radius must successfully save vs. spell or suffer full damage. To be removed safely, the beans in the bag must be taken out by hand—''telekinesis'' won’t prevent them from exploding, nor will working them out with tools. If placed in dirt and watered, each pebble-like bean will “sprout” a creature or object. ''Bags of beans'' generally hold 3d4 beans, only 1 or 2 of which will be beneficial, the others sprouting monsters or useless things. For example:
{| class="wikitable"
	| Bean #1
	| Three shriekers spring up and begin wailing
	|-
	| Bean #2
	| An ''ice storm'' strikes the area
	|-
	| Bean #3
	| A poisonous raspberry bush with animated runners shoots up, but each of its 5d4 berries is a gem of 100 or 500 gp base value (or perhaps just worthless glass)
	|-
	| Bean #4
	| A hole opens in the ground; a purple worm or a ''djinni ring'' can be below
	|-
	| Bean #5
	| Smoke and gas cover an area of 50 foot radius for five turns; creatures in the smoke cloud can’t see and will be blinded for 1d6 rounds when they step out of the cloud.
	|-
	| Bean #6
	| A wyvern grows instantly and attacks; its sting is a ''javelin of piercing''
	|-
	| Bean #7
	| poison gas seeps out slowly, forming a cloud of 20 foot radius that persists for one turn; while it lasts it might turn some dirt at its center to magical dust (''appearance'', ''vanishing'', ''sneezing'' and ''choking'')
|}

Thought, imagination, and judgment on the part of the DM are required with this item.

'''Bag of Devouring:''' This bag appears to be an ordinary sack—possibly appearing to be empty, possibly holding beans. The sack is, however, the lure used by an extradimensional creature—this is one of its feeding orifices.

Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to “swallowing” if it is thrust within the bag. The ''bag of devouring'' is 90% likely to ignore any initial intrusions, but any time it senses living human flesh within, it is 60% likely to close and attempt to draw the whole victim in—base 75% chance for success less Strength bonus for “damage,” each +1 = -5% on base chance. Thus, an 18 Strength character (with +2 damage) is only 65% likely to be drawn into the bag, while a 5 Strength character (with — 1 damage) is 80% likely to be drawn in.

The bag radiates magic. It can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It will act as a ''bag of holding'' (normal capacity), but each turn it has a 5% cumulative chance of “swallowing” the contents and then “spitting the stuff out” in some non-space. Creatures drawn within are consumed in one round, eaten, and gone forever.

'''Bag of Holding:''' As with other magical bags, this one appears to be a common cloth sack of about 2’ * 4! size. The ''bag of holding'' opens into a nondimensional space, and its inside is larger than its outside dimensions, Regardless of what is put into this item, the bag always weighs a fixed amount. This weight, the bag’s weight limit in contents, and its volume limit are determined by making a percentile roll and consulting the table below:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D100
	! Weight
	! Weight Limit
	! Volume Limit
	|-
	| 01-30
	| 15 lbs.
	| 250 lbs.
	| 30 cu, ft.
	|-
	| 31-70
	| 15 lbs.
	| 500 lbs.
	| 70 cu, ft.

	|-
	| 91-00
	| 60 lbs.
	| 1,500 lbs.
	| 250 cu, ft
|}
If overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag will rupture and be ruined. The contents will be lost forever in the vortices of nilspacce.

'''Bag of Transmuting:''' This magical sack appears to be a bag of holding of one of the four sizes described above. It will perform properly for 1d4 +11 uses (or more if the usages are made within a few day’s time). At some point, however, the magical field will waver, and metals and gems stored in the bag will be turned into common metals and stones of no worth.

When emptied, the bag pours forth these transmuted metals and minerals. Any magical items (other than artifacts and relics) placed in the bag will become ordinary lead, glass, or wood as appropriate (no saving throw) once the transmuting effects have begun.

'''Bag of Tricks:''' A ''bag of tricks'' appears to be a typical sack, and visual or other examination will show it to be empty when first discovered. However, anyone who reaches inside will feel a small, fuzzy object, If this object is taken from the bag and tossed one foot to 20 feet away, it will turn into one of the animals on the tollowing table.

These animals will obey and fight tor the individual who brought them into being. The kind of animal inside a ''bag of tricks'' varies each time an animal is drawn from the bag.

There are three types of ''bags of tricks'', each capable of producing different kinds of animals. To determine which kind of bag has been discovered, roll 1d10, On a 1-5, a type A bag has been found; on a 6-8, a type B; and on a 9 or 10, a type C. Thereafter, the wielder rolls a 1d8 on the appropriate table to determine the specific animal found:

Only one creature can be drawn forth at a time. It alone exists until it is slain, until one turn has elapsed, or until it is ordered back into the bag of tricks. At that point, the creature vanishes. Only then can another animal be brought forth. Up to 10 creatures can be drawn from the bag each week.

'''Beads of Force:''' These small, black spheres might be mistaken for common beads, marbles, or unusually black but Justerless pearls. From 5-8 of these beads are usually found at one time. Each is about three-quarters of an inch in diameter and quite heavy, weighing almost an ounce. One can be hurled up to 30 yards.

Upon impact, the bead sends forth a burst of force that inflicts 5d4 points of damage upon all creatures within a 10-foot radius of its center. Each victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. Those who save will be thrown out of the blast area, but those who fail to save will be encapsulated by a ''sphere of force'' after taking damage.

The sphere will form around any and all such creatures in the 10-foot-radius area, even those of large size, and will persist for 3d4 rounds. Victims will be unable to escape except by the same means used to bring down a ''wall of force'' spell.

'''Beaker of Plentiful Potions:''' This container resembles a jug or flask, It is a magical beaker with alchemical properties allowing it to create 1d4 +1 doses of 1d4 +1 potions. (The kinds of potions are determined by random selection. See Table 89, page 136.) Different potion sorts are layered in the container, and each pouring takes one round and results in one dose of one potion type.

Roll 1d4 +1, to find the number of potions the beaker contains. Rol) again to determine which potions the beaker contains —''delusion'' and ''poison'' are possible. Record each potion in order of occurrence—the potions are layered and are poured in order. Duplication is possible.

If the container holds only two potions, it will dispense them one each per day, three times per week; if three are contained, it will dispense them one each per day, two times per week; and if four or five are contained it will produce each just one time per week. Once opened, the beaker gradually loses the ability to produce potions. This reduction in ability results in the permanent loss of one potion type per month, determined randomly.

'''Boat, Folding:''' A folding boat will always be discovered as a small wooden “box” —about one foot long, one-half foot wide, and one-half foot deep. It will, of course, radiate magic if subjected to magical detection, The “box” can be used to store items like any other box, li a command word is given, however, the box will unfold itself to form a boat of 10’ length, four feet width and two feet depth. A second (different) command word will cause it to unfold to a 24-foot long, 8-foot wide, and 6-foot deep ship.

In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat is decked, has single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, anchor, a deck cabin, a mast, and square sail. The first can hold three or four people comfortably, the second will carry fifteen with ease.

A third word of command causes the boat to fold itself into a box once again. The words of command may be inscribed visibly or invisibly on the box, or they may be written elsewhere—perhaps on an item within the box. The words might have been lost, making the boat useless (except as a small box) until the finder discovers the words himself (via ''legend lore'', consulting a sage, physica) search of a dungeon, etc.).

'''Boccob’s Blessed Book:''' This well-made tome is always of small size. One will typically be no more than 12 inches tall, 6 inches wide, and 1 inch thick—some are a mere 6 inches in height. All such books are durable, waterproof, iron- and silver-bound, and locked, Copies of ''Boccob’s blessed book'' gain a +3 bonus on their saving throws (as “leather or book”).

The pages of such a book accept magic spells scribed upon them, and any book can contain up to 45 spells of any level. The book is thus highly prized by wizards of all sorts as a traveling spell book, It is unlikely that such a libram will ever be discovered (randomly) with spells already inscribed—inscribed or partially inscribed works of this nature are kept carefully by their owners.

'''Book of Exalted Deeds:''' This holy book is sacred to clerics of good alignment. Study of the work will require one week, but upon completion the good cleric will gain one point of Wisdom and experience points sufficient to place him halfway into the next level of experience. Clerics neither good nor evil lose 20,000-80,000 experience points for perusing the work (a negative xp total is possible, requiring restoration but not lowering level below Ist). Evil clerics lose one full experience level, dropping to the lowest number of experience points possible to hold the level; furthermore, they have to atone by magical means or by offering up 50% of everything they gain for 1d4 +1 adventures.

Fighters who handle or read the book are unaffected, though a paladin will sense that it is good. Mages who read it lose one point of Intelligence unless they save versus spell. If they fail to save, they lose 2,000-20,000 experience points. A thief who handles or reads the work sustains 5d6 points of damage and must successfully save vs. spell or lose one point of Dexterity. A thief also has a 10%-60% chance of giving up his profession to become a good cleric if Wisdom is 15 or higher. Bards are treated as neutral priests.

Except as indicated above, the writing in a ''book of exalted deeds'' can’t be distinguished from any other magical book, libram, tome, etc. It must be perused. (This applies also to all other works of magical writing detailed below.) Once perused, the book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character ever benefit from perusing a similar tome a second time.

'''Book of Infinite Spells:''' This magical work bestows upon any character of any class the ability to use the spells within its pages. However, upon first reading the work, any character not already able to use spells suffers 5d4 points of damage and is stunned for 5d4 turns. Thereafter, he can examine the writing without further harm. The ''book of infinite spells'' contains d8 + 22 pages. The nature of each page is determined by random die roll. Make a percentile roll and consult the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D100 Roll
	! Page Contents
	|-
	| 01-30 Blank page
	|-
	| 31-60 Priest spell
	|-
	| 61-00 Wizard spell
|}

If a spell is written on a page, determine the spell level by rolling 1d10 for a priest spell and 1d12 for a wizard spell. If the result is 8-10 (for priest) or 10-12 (for wizard) make a second die roll—1d6 for priests, 1d8 for wizard spells. Once the spell level is known, the DM can select particular spells or determine them randomly. Record page contents secretly, and ''do not reveal this information to the holder of the book''.

Once a page is turned it can never be flipped back—paging through a book of infinite spells is a one-way trip, When the last page is turned, the book vanishes. The owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened, once per day only. (If the spell is one that the character would normally be able to cast by reason of class and level, however, the spell can be cast up to four times per day due to the book’s magical powers.) The owner of the book need not have the book on his person in order to use its power.

The book can be stored in a place of safety while the owner is adventuring and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power.

Each time a spell is cast there is a chance that the energy connected with its use will cause the page to magically turn (despite all precautions). The owner will know this and possibly even benefit from the turning by gaining access to a new spell, The chance of a page turning is as follows:

:Spellcaster employing spells usable by own class and/or level .... 10%
:Spellcaster using spell foreign to own class and/or level ........ 20%
:Nonspellcaster using priest spell ................................ 25%
:Nonspellcaster using wizard spell ................................ 30%

Treat each spell use as if a scroll were being employed, including time of casting, spell failure, etc.

'''Book of Vile Darkness:''' This is a work of ineffable evil—meat and drink to priests of that alignment. To fully consume the contents requires one week of study, but once this has been accomplished, the evil priest gains one point of Wisdom and enough experience points to place him halfway into the next level of experience.

Priests neither good nor evil who read the book either lose 30,000-120,000 experience points or become evil without benefit from the book; there is a 50% chance for either. Good priests perusing the pages of the unspeakable ''book of vile darkness'' will have to successfully save vs. poison or die; and if they do not die they must successfully save vs. spell or become permanently insane. In the latter event, even if the save is successful, the priest loses 250,000 experience points, less 10,000 for each point of Wisdorn he has.

Other characters of good alignment suffer 5d6 points of damage from handling the tome, and if they look inside, there is an 80% chance a night hag will attack the character that night. Non-evil neutral characters suffer 5d4 points of damage from handling the book, and reading its pages causes them to succeed on a save vs. poison or become evil, immediately seeking out an evil priest to confirm their new alignment (see ''Book of Exalted Deeds'' for other details).

'''Boots of Dancing:''' These magical boots expand or contract to fit any foot size, from halfling to giant (just as other magical boots do). They radiate a dim magic if detection is used. They are indistinguishable from other magical boots, and until actual melee combat is engaged in they function like one of the other types of useful boots below—DM’s choice.

When the wearer is in (or fleeing from) melee combat, the ''boots of dancing'' impede movement, begin to tap and shuffle, heel and toe, or shuffle off to Buffalo, making the wearer behave as if ''Otto’s irresistible dance'' spell had been cast upon him (4 penalty to Armor Class rating, saving throws with a —6, and no attacks possible). Only a ''remove curse'' spell will enable the boots to be removed once their true nature is revealed.

'''Boots of Elvenkind:''' These soft boots enable the wearer to move without sound of footfall in virtually any surroundings. Thus the wearer can walk across a patch of dry leaves or over a creaky wooden floor and make only a whisper of noise—95 % chance of silence in the worst of conditions, 100% in the best.

'''Boots of Levitation:''' As with other magical boots, these soft boots expand or contract to fit giant to halfling-sized feet. ''Boots of levitation'' enable the wearer to ascend or descend vertically, at will. The speed of ascent/descent is 20 feet per round, with no limitation on duration.

The amount of weight the boots can levitate is randomly determined in 14-pound increments by rolling 1d20 and adding the result to a base of 280 pounds (i.e., a given pair of boots can levitate from 294 to 560 pounds of weight). Thus, an ogre could wear such boots, but its weight would be too great to levitate. (See the 2nd-level wizard spell, ''levitation''.)

'''Boots of the North:''' This footgear bestows many powers upon the wearer. First, he is able to travel across snow at normal rate of movement, leaving no tracks. The boots also enable the wearer to travel at half normal movement rate across the most slippery ice (horizontal surfaces only, not vertical or sharply slanted ones) without falling or slipping. ''Boots of the north'' warm the wearer, so that even in a temperature as low as -50 degrees F., he is comfortable with only scant clothing—a loin cloth and cloak, for instance. If the wearer of the boots is fully dressed in cold-weather clothing, he can withstand temperatures as low as -100 degrees F.

'''Boots of Speed:''' These boots enable the wearer to run at the speed of a fast horse—24 base movement speed. For every 10 pounds of weight over 200 pounds, the wearer is slowed by 1 in movement, so a 180-pound human with 60 pounds of gear would move at 20 base movement rate.

For every hour of continuous fast movement, the wearer must rest an hour. No more than eight hours of continuous fast movement are possible before the wearer must rest. Boots of speed give a +2 bonus to Armor Class in combat situations in which movement of this sort is possible.

'''Boots of Striding and Springing:''' The wearer of these magical boots has a base movement rate of 12, regardless of size or weight. This speed can be maintained tirelessly for up to 12 hours per day, but thereafter the boots no longer function for 12 hours—they need that long to “recharge.”

In addition to the striding ability, these boots allow the wearer to make great leaps. While “normal” paces for the individual wearing this type of footgear are three feet long, the boots also enable forward jumps of up to 30 feet, backward leaps of 9 feet, and vertical springs of 15 feet.

If circumstances permit the use of such movement in combat, the wearer can effectively strike and spring away when he has the initiative during a melee round. However, such activity involves a degree of danger—there is a base 20% chance that the wearer of the boots will stumble and be stunned on the following round, Adjust the 20% chance downward by 3% for each point of Dexterity the wearer has above 12 (i.e., 17% at 13 Dexterity, 14% at 14, 11% at 15, 8% at 16, 5% at 17, and only 2% at 18 Dexterity). In any event, the boots better Armor Class by 1 due to the quickness of movement they allow, so Armor Class 2 becomes 1, Armor Class 1 becomes 0, etc.

'''Boots of Varied Tracks:''' The wearer of these ordinary-looking boots is able, on command, to alter the tracks he leaves. The footprints of the wearer can be made as small as those of a halfling or as large as those of an ogre, bare or shod as desired, In addition, each pair of these boots has four additional track-making capabilities. Roll 1d6 four times to determine the subtable used, followed by 1d8 four times:

'''Boots, Winged:''' These boots appear to be ordinary footgear. If magic is detected for, they radiate a faint aura of both enchantment and alteration. When they are on the possessor’s feet and he or she concentrates on the desireto fly, the boots sprout wings at the heel and empower the wearer to fly, without having to maintain the concentration.

The wearer can use the boots for up to two hours per day, all at once or in several shorter flights. If the wearer tries to use them for a longer duration, the power of the boots fades rapidly, but it doesn’t abruptly disappear—the wearer slowly descends to the ground.

For every twelve hours of uninterrupted non-use, the boots regain one hour of flying power. No amount of non-use allows the boots to be used for more than two hours at a time, however.

Some ''winged boots'' are better than others. To determine the quality of a given pair, roll 1d4 and consult the table below:

'''Bowl Commanding Water Elementals:''' This large container is usually fashioned from blue or green semi-precious stone (malachite or lapis lazuli, for example, or sometimes jade), It is about one foot in diameter, half that deep, and relatively fragile. When the bow! is filled with fresh or salt water, and certain words are spoken, a water elemental of 12 Hit Dice will appear. The summoning words require one round to speak.

Note that if salt water is used, the elemental will be stronger (+2 per Hit Die, maximum 8 hp per die, however). Information about water elementals can be found in the ''Monstrous Compendium''. (See also ''bowl of watery death'' below.)

'''Bowl of Watery Death:''' This device looks exactly like a ''bowl commanding water elementals'', right down to the color, design, magical radiation, etc. However, when it is filled with water, the wizard must successfully save vs. spell or be shrunk to the size of a small ant and plunged into the center of the bowl. If salt water is poured into the bowl, the saving throw suffers a -2 penalty.

The victim will drown in 1d6 +2 rounds, unless magic is used to save him, for he cannot be physically removed from the ''bowl of watery death'' except by magical means: ''animal growth'', ''enlarge'', or ''wish'' are the only spells that will free the victim and restore normal size; a ''potion of growth'' poured into the water will have the same effect; a ''sweet water potion'' will grant the victim another saving throw (i.e., a chance that the curse magic of the bowl works only briefly), If the victim drowns, death is permanent, no resurrection is possible, and even a ''wish'' will not work.

'''Bracers of Archery:''' These magica) wrist bands are indistinguishable from normal, nonmagical protective wear. When worn by a character type or creature able to employ a bow, they enable the wearer to excel at archery.

The bracers empower such a wearer to use any bow (not including crossbows) as if he were proficient in its usage, if such is not already the case. If the wearer of the bracers has proficiency with any type of bow, he gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls and a +1 bonus to damage inflicted whenever that type of bow is used. These bonuses are cumulative with any others, including those already bestowed by a magical bow or magical arrows, except for a bonus due to weapon specialization.

'''Bracers of Brachiation:''' These wrist bands appear to be of the ordinary sort, but they enable the wearer to move by swinging from one tree limb, vine, etc., to another to get from place to place. The power can be employed only in locales where these sorts of hand-holds can be found. Movement is at a rate of 3, 6, or 9—the more jungle-like the conditions, the greater the movement rate.

The wearer is also able to climb trees, vines, poles, ropes, etc., at a rate of 6, and can on a rope, vine, or other dangling, flexible object as if he were an ape.

The wearer can also jump as if wearing ''boots of striding and springing'', but the jump must culminate in the grasping of a rope or vine, movement through the upper portion of trees, the climbing of a tree or pole, or some other activity associated with brachiation.

'''Bracers of Defense:''' These items appear to be wrist or arm guards. Their magic bestows an effective Armor Class equal to someone wearing armor and employing a shield. If armor is actually worn, the bracers have no additional effect, but they do work in conjunction with other magical items of protection. The Armor Class the bracers of defense bestow is determined by making a percentile roll and consulting the table below:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D100 roll
	! Armor Class
	|-
	| 01-05
	| 8
	|-
	| 06-15

	|-
	| 16-35

	| 4
	|-
	| 71-85
	| 3
	|-
	| 86-00
	| 2
|}

'''Bracers of Defenselessness:''' These appear to be ''bracers of defense'', and will actually serve as such until the wearer is attacked in anger by a dangerous enemy. At that moment, the bracers worsen Armor Class to 10 and negate any and all other magical protections and Dexterity bonuses. ''Bracers of defenselessness'' can be removed only by means of a ''remove curse'' spell.

'''Brazier Commanding Fire Elementals:''' This device appears to be a normal container for holding burning coals unless magic is detected for. It enables a mage to summon an elemental of 12-Hit-Dice strength from the elemental plane of Fire. A fire must be lit in the brazier—one round is required to do so, If sulphur is added, the elemental will gain +1 on each Hit Die (i.e., 2-9 hit points per Hit Die). The fire elemental will appear as soon as the fire is burning and a command word is uttered. (See ''Monstrous Compendium'' tor other details.)

'''Brazier of Sleep Smoke:''' This device is exactly like the ''brazier commanding fire elementals''. However, when a fire is started within it, the burning causes a great cloud of magical smoke to pour forth in a 10-foot radius from the brazier. All creatures within the cloud must successfully save vs. spell or fall into a deep sleep.

At the same moment, a fire elemental of 12 Hit Dice appears and attacks the nearest creature. Sleeping creatures can be awakened only by means of a ''dispel magic'' or ''remove curse'' spell,

'''Brooch of Shielding:''' This appears to be a piece of silver or gold jewelry (10% chance that there are jewels set in it). It is used to fasten a cloak or cape. In addition to this mundane task, it can absorb magic missiles of the sort generated by spell, wand, or other magical device. A brooch can absorb up to 101 points of magic missile damage before it melts and becomes useless. Its use can be determined only by means of a ''detect magic'' spell and then experimentation.

'''Broom of Animated Attack:''' This is indistinguishable from a normal broom, except by means of detection of its magic. It is identical to a ''broom of flying'' by all tests short of attempted use. Using it reveals that a ''broom of animated attack'' is a very nasty item:

If a command word (“fly.” “soar,” etc.) is spoken, the broom will do a loop-the-loop with its hopeful rider, dumping him on his head from 1d4+5 feet off the ground. The broom will then attack the stunned victim, swatting the face with the straw/twig end to blind and beating with the handle end.

The broom gets two attacks per round with each end (two swats with the straw, two with the handle). lt attacks as if it were a 4-Hit-Dice monster, The straw end causes blindness for one round if it hits. The other end causes 1d3 points of damage when it hits. The broom is Armor Class 7 and takes 18 hit points to destroy.

'''Broom of Flying:''' This magical broom is able to fly through the air at up to 30 base movement speed, The broom can carry 182 pounds at this rate, but every 14 additional pounds slows movement by 1. The device can climb or dive at an angle of 30 degrees. A command word (determined by the DM) must be used, The broom will travel alone to any destination named. It will come to its owner from as far away as 300 yards when he speaks the command word.

'''Bucknard’s Everfull Purse:''' This item appears to be a leather pouch or small bag. Each morning it duplicates certain coins—and possibly gems as well. When found, the purse will be full of coins. If totally emptied, and left so for more than a few minutes, the magic of the purse is lost, but if one of any coin is placed within the bag, many coins of the same type will be found inside the next morning. The types of coins found is determined by consulting the table below.

Once the type of bag is determined by roll, its abilities will not change.

&#42; Base 10 gp gems that can increase to a maximum of 100 gp only.

'''Candle of Invocation:''' These specially blessed tapers are dedicated to the pantheon of gods of one of the nine alignments. The typical candle is not remarkable, but if a ''detection'' spell is cast, it will radiate magic, lt also radiates good or evil, if appropriate.

Simply burning the candle generates a favorable aura for the individual so doing—if the candle’s alignment matches that of the character’s. If burned by a priest of the same alignment, the candle temporarily increases the priest’s level of experience by 2, enabling him to cast additional spells. He can even cast spells normally unavailable to him, as if he were of the higher level, but only so long as the candle continues to burn, Any burning allows the casting of a ''gate'' spell, the respondent being of the alignment of the candle, but the taper is immediately consumed in the process.

Otherwise, each candle burns for four hours. It is possible to extinguish the candle as one would any other. However, it can be placed in a lantern or otherwise sheltered to protect it from drafts and other things which could put it out. This doesn’t affect its magical properties.

'''Carpet of Flying:''' The size, carrying capacity, and speed of a carpet are determined by rolling percentile dice and consulting the table below. Each carpet has its own command word (if you use the optional command word rules) to activate it—if the device is within voice range, the command word will activate it. The carpet is then controlled by spoken directions.

These rugs are of oriental make and design. Each is beautiful and durable. Note, however, that tears or other rents cannot be repaired without special weaving techniques generally known only in distant, exotic lands.

'''Censer Controlling Air Elementals:''' This 6” wide, 1’ high perforated golden vessel resembles thuribles found in places of worship. If filled with incense and lit, a command word need only be spoken to summon forth a 12 Hit Dice air elemental on the following round. If ''incense of meditation'' is burned within the censer, the air elemental will have a +3 bonus to each of its Hit Dice, and it will obey the commands of its summoner. If the censer is extinguished, the elemental will remain and turn on the summoner (see Elemental in the ''Monstrous Compendium'').

'''Censer of Summoning Hostile Air Elementals:''' This thurible is indistinguishable from other magical and ordinary censers. It is cursed: any incense burned within it causes 1d4 enraged air elementals to appear, one per round, These attack any and all creatures within sight. The censer cannot be extinguished, and it will burn until either the summoner or the elementals have been killed.

'''Chime of Hunger:''' This device looks exactly like a ''chime of opening''. In fact, it will operate as a ''chime of opening'' for several uses before its Curse is put into operation.

When the curse takes effect, at the DM’s discretion, striking the chime causes all creatures within 60° to be immediately struck with ravenous hunger. Characters will tear into their rations, ignoring everything else, even dropping everything they are holding in order to eat. Creatures without food immediately available will rush to where the ''chime of hunger'' sounded and attack any creatures there in order to kill and eat them.

All creatures must eat for at least one round. After that, they are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell on each successive round until they succeed, At that point, hunger is satistied.

'''Chime of Interruption:''' This magical instrument can be struck once per turn. Its resonant tone lasts for three full rounds. While the chime is resonating, no spell requiring a verbal component can be cast within a 30-foot radius of it unless the caster is able to make a saving throw vs. breath weapon, After its effects fade, the chime must be rested for at least seven rounds. If it is struck again before this time elapses, no sound issues forth, and a full turn must elapse from that point in time before it can again be sounded.

'''Chime of Opening:''' A ''chime of opening'' is a hollow mithral tube about 1’ long. When it is struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, etc. The ''chime of opening'' also destroys the magic of a ''hold portal'' spell or even a ''wizard lock'' cast by a wizard of less than 15th level,

The chime must be pointed at the area of the item or gate which is to be loosed or opened. It is then struck, a clear chiming ring sounds (which may attract monsters), and in one round the target lock is unlocked, the shackle is loosed, the secret door is opened, or the lid of the chest is lifted. If a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and ''wizard locked'', it will take tour soundings of the chime of opening to get it open. A ''silence'' spell negates the power of the device. The chime has 1d8x 10 charges before it cracks and becomes useless.

'''Cloak of Arachnida:''' This black garment gives the wearer the ability to climb as if a ''spider climb'' spell had been placed upon him. When magic is detected for, the cloak radiates a strong aura of alteration magic.

In addition to the wall-climbing ability, the cloak grants the wearer immunity to entrapment by webs of any sort—the wearer can actually move in webs at a rate equal to that of the spider that created the web, or at a base movement rate of 6 in other cases.

Once per day the wearer of this cloak can cast a double-sized ''web''. This operates like the 2nd-level wizard spell.

Finally, the wearer is less subject to the poison of arachnids. He gains a +2 bonus to all saving throws vs. such poison.

'''Cloak of the Bat:''' Fashioned of dark brown or black cloth, a cloak of this type is not readily noticeable as unusual. It radiates both enchantment and_ alteration in equal proportions. The cloak bestows a 90% probability of being invisible when the wearer is stationary within a shadowy or dark place. The wearer is also able to hang upside down from the ceiling, like a bat, and to maintain this same chance of invisibility.

By holding the edges of the garment, the wearer is able to fly at a speed of 15 (Maneuver Class: B), If he desires, the wearer can actually transform himself into an ordinary bat—all possessions worn or carried will be part of the transformation—and fly accordingly. Flying, either with the cloak or as an ordinary bat, can be accomplished only in darkness (either under the night sky or in a lightless or near-lightless environment underground). Either of the flying powers is usable for up to one hour at a time, but after a flight of any duration, the cloak will not bestow any flying power for a like period of time.

The cloak also provides a +2 bonus to Armor Class. This benefit extends to the wearer even when he is in bat form.

'''Cloak of Displacement:''' This item appears to be a normal cloak, but when it is worn by a character its magical properties distort and warp light waves. This displacement of light waves causes the wearer to appear to be 1’ to 2’ from his actual position. Any missile or melee attack aimed at the wearer automatically misses the first time. This can apply to first attacks from multiple opponents only if the second and successive attackers were unable to observe the initial displacement miss.

After the first attack, the cloak affords a +2 bonus to protection (i.e., two classes better on Armor Class), as well as a +2 bonus to saving throws versus attacks directed at the wearer (such as spells, gaze weapon attacks, spitting and breath attacks, etc., which are aimed at the wearer of the ''cloak of displacement'').

Note that 75% of all ''cloaks of displacement'' are sized for humans or elves (persons 5’ to 6’ 6 Miscellaneous Magic (Cloaks) tall), and 25% are sized for persons of about 4’ height (dwarves, gnomes, halflings).

'''Cloak of Elvenkind:''' This cloak of neutral gray cloth is indistinguishable from an ordinary cloak of the same color. However, when it is worn, with the hood drawn up around the head, it enables the wearer to be nearly invisible—the cloak has chameleon-like powers.

Outdoors, in natural surroundings, the wearer of the cloak is almost totally invisible; in other settings, he is nearly so. However, the wearer is easily seen if violently or hastily moving, regardless of the surroundings. The invisibility bestowed is:

Fully 90% of these cloaks are sized for human or elven-sized persons. The other 10% are sized for smaller persons (4’ or so in height).

'''Cloak of the Manta Ray:''' This cloak appears to be made of leather until the wearer enters salt water. At that time the ''cloak of the manta ray'' adheres to the individual, and he appears nearly identical to a manta ray—there is only a 10% chance that someone seeing the wearer will know he isn’t a manta ray.

The wearer can breathe underwater and has a movement rate of 18, like a manta ray (see the ''Monstrous Compendium''). The wearer also has an Armor Class of at least six, that of a manta ray. Other magical protections or magical armor can improve that armor value.

Although the cloak does not enable the wearer to bite opponents as a manta ray does, the garment has a tail spine which can be used to strike at opponents behind him. The spine inflicts 1d6 points of damage, and there is no chance of stunning. This attack can be used in addition to other sorts, for the wearer can release his arms from the cloak without sacrificing underwater movement if so desired.

'''Cloak of Poisonousness:''' This particular cloak is usually made of a wool-like material, although it can be made of leather. It radiates magic. The cloak can be handled without harm, but as soon as it is actually donned, the wearer is stricken stone dead.

A ''cloak of poisonousness'' can be removed only with a ''remove curse'' spell—this destroys the magical properties of the cloak. If a ''neutralize poison'' spell is then used, it may be possible to revive the victim with a ''raise dead'' or ''resurrection'' spell, but there is a -10% chance of success because of the poison.

'''Cloak of Protection:''' The various forms of this marvelous device all appear to be normal garments made of cloth or leather. However, each plus of a ''cloak of protection'' betters Armor Class by one and adds one to saving throw die rolls. Thus, a ''cloak +1'' would lower Armor Class 10 (no armor) to Armor Class 9, and give a +1 bonus to saving throw rolls. To determine how powerful a given cloak is, roll percentile dice and consult the table below:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D100 Roll
	! Power
	|-
	| 01-35
	| cloak +1
	|-
	| 36-65
	| cloak +2
	|-
	| 66-85
	| cloak +3
	|-
	| 86-95
	| cloak +4
	|-
	| 96-00
	| cloak +5
|}

This device can be combined with other items or worn with leather armor. It cannot function in conjunction with any sort of magical armor, normal armor not made of leather, or with a shield of any sort.

'''Crystal Ball:''' This is the most common form of scrying device: a crystal sphere about 6” in diameter. A wizard can use the device to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence. The user of a ''crystal ball'' must know the subject to be viewed. Knowledge can be from personal acquaintance, possession of personal belongings, a likeness of the object, or accumulated information, Knowledge, rather than distance, is the key to how successful location will be:
{| class="wikitable"
	! Subject is
	! Chance of Locating*
	|-
	| Personally well known
	| 100%
	|-
	| Personally known slightly
	| 85%
	|-
	| Pictured
	| 50%
	|-
	| Part of in possession
	| 50%
	|-
	| Garment in posession
	| 25%
	|-
	| Well informed of
	| 25%
	|-
	| Slightly informed of
	| 20%
	|-
	| On another plane
	| -25%
|}
&#42; Unless masked by magic.

The chance of locating also dictates how long and how frequently a wizard will be able to view the subject:
{| class="wikitable"
	! Chances of Locating*
	! Viewing Period
	! Frequency
	|-
	| 100% or more
	| 1 hour
	| 3 times/day
	|-
	| 99% to 90%
	| 30 minutes
	| 3 times/day
	|-
	| 89% to 75%
	| 20 minutes
	| 2 times/day
	|-
	| 74% to 50%
	| 30 minutes
	| 1 time/day
	|-
	| 49% to 25%
	| 15 minutes
	| 1 time/day
	|-
	| 24% or less
	| 10 minutes
	| 1 time/day
|}
&#42; Unless masked by magic.

Viewing beyond the periods or frequencies noted will force the wizard to roll a saving throw vs. spell each round, A failed saving throw permanently lowers the character’s Intelligence by one point and drives him insane until healed.

Certain spells cast upon the user of the ''crystal ball'' can improve his chances of using the device successfully. These are ''comprehend languages'', ''read magic'', ''infravision'', and ''tongues'', Two spells—''detect magic'' and ''detect evil/good''—can be cast through a ''crystal ball''. The chance of success is 5% per level of experience of the wizard.

Certain ''crystal balls'' have additional powers. These spell functions operate at 10th level. To determine whether a ''crystal ball'' has extra powers, roll percentile dice and consult the table below:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D100 Roll
	! Additional Power
	|-
	| 01-50
	| crystal ball
	|-
	| 51-75
	| crystal ball with clairaudience
	|-
	| 76-90
	| crystal ball with ESP
	|-
	| 91-00
	| crystal ball with telepathy*
|}
&#42; Communication only.

Only creatures with Intelligence of 12 or better have a chance of noticing that they are the subjects of scrying. The base chance is determined by class.
{| class="wikitable"
	| Fighter
	| Paladin
	| Ranger
	| Bard
	| Thief
	| Spell-USer
	|-
	| 2%
	| 6%
	| 4%
	| 3%
	| 6%
	| 8%
|}
For each point of Intelligence above 12, the creature has an additiona) arithmetically ascending cumulative chance beginning at 1% (i.e., 1% at Intelligence 13, 3% at 14, 6% at 15, 10% at 16, 15% at 17, 21% at 18 Intelligence, and so on). These creatures also have a cumulative chance of 1% per level of experience or Hit Dice of detecting scrying. Treat monsters as the group as which they make saving throws. Check each round of scrying, and it the percentage or less is rolled, the subject becomes aware of being watched.

A ''dispel magic'' will cause a ''crystal ball'' to cease functioning for one day, The various protections against ''crystal ball'' viewing will simply leave the device hazy and nonfunctioning.

You may allow other scrying devices for clerics and druids—water basins and mirrors are suggested. Have them function as normal ''crystal balls''.

'''Crystal Hypnosis Ball:''' This cursed item is indistinguishable from a normal ''crystal ball'', and it radiates magic, but not evil, if detected for. Any wizard attempting to use it will become hypnotized, and a telepathic ''suggestion'' will be implanted in his mind.

The user of the device will believe that the desired object was viewed, but actually he came partially under the influence of a powerful wizard, lich, or even some power/being from another plane. Each further use brings the ''crystal ball'' gazer more under the influence of the creature, either as a servant or tool. The DM decides whether to make this a gradual or sudden affair according to the surroundings and circumstances peculiar to the finding of the ''crystal hypnosis ball'' and the character(s) locating it.

'''Cube of Force:''' This device can be made of ivory, bone, or any hard mineral. It is about the size of a large die—perhaps ¾” across—and enables its possessor to put up a ''wall of force'' 10’ per side around his person. This cubic screen is impervious to the attack forms shown on the table below. The cube has 36 charges, and this energy is restored each day. The holder presses one face of the cube to activate or deactivate the field:
{| class="wikitable"
	! Cube Face
	! Charge Cost Per Turn/Movement Rate
	! Effect
	|-
	| 1
	| 1/1
	| keeps out gases, wind, etc.

	| 2
	| 2/8

	|-
	| 6
	| 0/normal
	| deactivates
|}
When the force screen is up, the following attacks cost extra charges from the cube jin order to maintain the integrity of the screen. Note that these spells cannot be cast either into or out of the cube:
{| class="wikitable"
	! Attack Form
	! Extra Charges

'''Cube of Frost Resistance:''' When the cube is activated it encloses an area 10’ per side, resembling a ''cube of force''. The temperature within this area is always 65 degrees F. The field will absorb all cold-based attacks (i,e., ''cone of cold'', ''ice storm'', and even white dragon’s breath). However, if the field is subjected to more than 50 points of cold damage in any turn (10 rounds), it collapses and cannot be renewed for one hour. If it receives over 100 points of damage in one turn, the cube is destroyed.

Cold below 0 degrees F. effectively inflicts 2 points of cold damage on the cube for every -10 degrees, so that the cube is at -2 when the temperature of the attact is at -1 to -10 degrees F., -4 at -11 to -20, etc. Thus, at -40 degrees F. the device can withstand only 42 points of damage.

'''Cubic Gate:''' Another small cubic device, this item is fashioned from carnelian. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a plane, one of which will always be the Prime Material, The other five sides/planes can be determined by the DM in any manner he chooses.

If a side of the ''cubic gate'' is pressed once, it opens a nexus to the appropriate plane. There is a 10% chance per turn that something will come through it looking for food, fun, or trouble.

If a side is pressed twice, the creature so doing, along with all creatures in a 5° radius will be drawn through the nexus to the other plane. It is impossible to open more than one nexus at a time.

'''Daern’s Instant Fortress:''' This metal cube is small, but when activated it grows to form a tower 20’ square and 30’ high, with arrow slits on all sides and a machicolated battlement atop it. The metal walls extend 10’ into the ground. The fortress has a small door which will open only at the command of the owner of the fortress—even ''knock'' spells can’t open the door.

The adamantite walls of ''Daern’s instant fortress'' are unaffected by normal weapons other than catapults. The tower can absorb 200 points of damage before collapsing. Damage sustained is cumulative, and the fortress cannot be repaired (although a ''wish'' will restore 10 points of damage sustained).

The fortress springs up in just one round, with the door facing the device’s owner, The door will open and close instantly at his command. People and creatures (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress’s sudden growth. Anyone so caught sustains 10d10 points of damage.

'''Decanter of Endless Water:''' This stoppered flask looks ordinary but radiates the aura of magic. If the stopper is removed, and the proper words spoken, a stream of fresh or salt water pours out, as ordered, There are separate command words for the amount as well as the type of water. Water can be made to come forth as follows:
:''Stream:'' pours out 1 gallon per round
:''Fountain:'' 5’ long stream at 5 gallons per round
:''Geyser:'' 20’ long stream at 30 gallons per round

The geyser causes considerable back pressure, and the holder must be well braced or be knocked over. The force of the geyser will kill smal) animals and insects (mice, moles, small bats, etc.). The command word must be given to cease.

'''Deck of Illusions:''' This set of parchment cards is usually found in an ivory, leather, or wood box. A full deck consists of 34 cards of 4 suits. When a card is drawn at random and thrown to the ground, an illusion with audible and visual components is formed. This lasts until dispelled. The illusionary creature will not go more than 30 feet away from where the card landed, but will otherwise move and act as if it were real. When the ''illusion'' is dispelled, the card becomes blank and cannot be used again. If the card is picked up, the illusion is automatically and instantly dispelled. The cards in a deck and the ''illusions'' they bring forth are as follows:

The cards in a particular deck may differ from these, and a deck may be discovered with some of its cards missing, The ''illusions'' perform normal routines and respond to attacks—they should be played as if they were real creatures.

'''Deck of Many Things:''' A ''deck of many things'' (beneficial and baneful) is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards, or plaques, made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and magical sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse.

The character with a ''deck of many things'' can announce that he is drawing only one card, or he can draw two, three, four, or more. However, the number must be announced prior to drawing the first card. If a jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw two additional cards.

Each time a card is taken from the deck it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is a jester or fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A ''deck of many things'' contains either 13 cards (75% chance) or 22 cards (25%), Additional cards in a 22-card deck are indicated below by an asterisk (“) before their names, To simulate the magical cards you may want to use the normal playing card in the suits indicated in the second column. (The notation is face value, then suit.)

Upon drawing the last card possible, or immediately upon drawing the cards in bold face (The Void and Donjon), the deck disappears. The cards are explained in greater detail below:

''Sun:'' Roll for a miscellaneous magical item (Table 88) until a useful item is indicated.

''Moon:'' This is best represented by a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of wishes shown as gleams therein. These wishes are the same as the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used in a number of turns equal to the number received.

''Star:'' If the two points would place the character’s score at 19, use one or both in any of the other abilities in this order; Constitution, Charisma, Wisdom, Dexterity, Intelligence, Strength.

''Comet:'' The player must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster(s) encountered or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character moves to the mid-point of the next experience level.

''Throne:'' If Charisma is 18 already, the individual still gains five on encounter and loyalty reactions. He becomes a real leader in people’s eyes. The castle gained will be near a stronghold already possessed (if any).

''Key:'' DM must prepare a treasure map, The weapon must be one usable by the character, so use the Magical Weapons Table until a useful item is awarded.

''Knight:'' The fighter will join as the character’s henchman and loyally serve until death. He has +1 per die (18 maximum) on each ability roll.

''Gem:'' This indicates wealth. The jewelry will all be gold set with gems, the gems all of 1,000 gp base value. With this wealth should come experience points equal in value, but never more than needed to increase one level of experience.

''The Void:'' This black card spells instant disaster. The character’s body continues to function, though he or she speaks like an automaton, but the psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere—in an object on a far planet or plane, possibly in the possession of an outer planar creature. A wish will not bring the character back, but the plane of entrapment might be revealed. Draw no more cards.

''Flames:'' Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outer planar creature can’t be ended until one of the parties has been slain.

''Skull:'' A minor Death appears (AC -4; 33 hit points; strikes with a scythe for 2d8 points, never missing, always striking first in around). The character must fight it alone—if others help, they get minor Deaths to fight as well. If the character is slain, he is slain forever. Treat the Death as undead with respect to spells. Cold, fire, and electrical energy do not harm it.

''Talons:'' When this card is drawn, every magical item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably gone.

''Ruin:'' As implied, when this card is drawn every bit of money (including all gems, jewelry, treasure, and art objects) is lost. All land and buildings currently owned are lost forever as well.

''Euryale:'' The medusa-like visage of this card brings a curse only the Fates card or god-like beings can remove. The -3 penalty to all saving throws is otherwise permanent.

''Rogue:'' When this card is drawn, one of the character’s henchmen will be totally alienated and forever-after hostile. If the character has no henchmen, the enmity of some powerful personage—community or religious—can be substituted, The hatred will be secret until the time is ripe for devastating effect.

''Balance:'' As in “weighed in the balance and found wanting,” the character must change to a radically different alignment. Failure to act according to the new alignment may bring penalties (as described in the section on Character Alignment, page 24). Discard the cards.

''jester:'' This card actually makes a pack more beneficial if the experience point award is taken. It is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Fool.

''Fool:'' The payment and draw are mandatory!

''Vizier:'' This card empowers the character drawing it with the ability to call upon supernatural wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question whenever he so requests. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another question entirely.

''Idiot:'' This card causes the loss of 1d4 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional.

''Fates:'' This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen—it can only stop something from happening, The reversal is only for the character who drew the card, and other party members may have to endure the confrontation.

''Donjon:'' This signifies imprisonment—either by spell or by some creature/being, at the DM’s option. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Whether these items are recoverable is, likewise, up to the DM. Draw no more cards.

'''Drums of Deafening:''' This item is actually a pair of kettle drums about 1½’ in diameter. These radiate magic, if so detected, but are otherwise unremarkable. If either is struck nothing happens, but if both are sounded together all creatures within 70’ are permanently deafened and will remain so untila ''heal'' spell or similar cure is used to restore shattered eardrums. Furthermore, those within 10’ of the drums will be stunned by the noise for 2d4 rounds.

'''Drums of Panic:''' These kettle drums, hemispheres about 1½’ in diameter, come in pairs and are unremarkable in appearance. If both of the pair are sounded, all creatures within 120’ (with the exception of those within a “safe zone” of 20’ radius from the drums) must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or turn and move directly away from the sound for one full turn.

Each turn thereafter, panicked creatures may attempt to save vs. spell again. Each failure brings another turn of movement away from the ''drums of panic''. Movement is at the fastest possible speed while fleeing in panic, and three rounds of rest are required for each turn of fast movement after the saving throw is made. Creatures with Intelligence of 2 roll saving throws ~2 with penalties, those with 1 or less roll with -4 penalties.

'''Dust of Appearance:''' This fine powder appears like any other dust unless a careful examination is conducted. This will reveal it to be a very fine, very light, metallic dust. A single handful of this substance flung into the air will coat all objects, making them visible even if they are invisible, out of phase, astral, or ethereal. Note that the dust will also reveal mirror images and projected images for what they are, and it likewise negates the effects of ''cloaks of displacement'' or ''elvenkind'' and ''robes of blending''. The dust’s effect lasts for 2d10 turns.

''Dust of Appearance'' is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone blow tubes. A packet can be shaken out to cover an area with a radius of 10’ from the user. A tube can be blown in a cone shape, 1’ wide at the start, 15’ at the end, and 20’ long. As few as 5 or as me as 50 containers may be found in one place.

'''Dust of Disappearance:''' This dust looks just like ''dust of appearance'', and it is typically stored in the same manner and quantity. All things touched by it reflect and bend light of all sorts (infrared and ultraviolet included), becoming invisible. Normal sight can’t see dusted creatures or objects, nor can they be detected by any normal detection or even magical means. Even ''detect invisibility'' spells don’t work. ''Dust of appearance'', however, does reveal people and objects made invisible by ''dust of disappearance''.

Invisibility bestowed by the dust lasts for 2d10 turns (1d10+10 if sprinkled carefully upon an object). Attack while thus invisible is possible, always by surprise if the opponent fails to note the invisible thing and always at an Armor Class 4 better than normal (while invisibility lasts). Unlike the ''invisibility'' spell, ''dust of disappearance'' remains effective even after an attack is made.

'''Dust of Dryness:''' This special dust has many uses. If a pinch is cast into a cubic yard of water, the liquid is instantly transformed to nothingness, and the dust pinch becomes a marble-sized pellet floating, or resting, where it was cast. If this pellet is hurled down, it breaks and releases the same volume of water. When the dust is sprinkled over an area (such as with a wave of the arm), it dries up as much as 15 cubic feet of water. The dust affects only water (whether fresh, salt, brackish, or alkaline), not other liquids. If the dust is employed against a water elemental or similar creature, the creature must save vs. spell or be destroyed. A successful save still inflicts 5d6é points of damage upon the water-creature.

A pouch of this dust contains 1d6+4 pinches.

'''Dust of Illusion:''' This unremarkable powder resembles chalk dust or powdered graphite—unless it is stared at. Stare at it and the dust changes color and form. Put a pinch of ''dust of illusion'' on a creature and the creature appears to become any other creature of similar shape, with a size variance of 50% (plus or minus) from the actual size of the affected creature. An unwilling recipient is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to escape the effect. Thus, a halfling could appear as a human of small stature, a human as an ogre, a pegasus as a mule, etc.

The individual who sprinkles the magical dust must envision the illusion desired as the powder is shaken over the subject creature. The illusionary power lasts for 1d6+6 hoursMiscellaneous Magic (Dusts) unless otherwise dispelled.

A typical pouch of this dust contains 1d10 + 10 pinches of the substance.

'''Dust of Sneezing and Choking:''' This fine dust appears to be either ''dust of appearance'' or ''dust of disappearance''. If spread, however, it causes those within a 20° radius to fall into fits of sneezing and coughing. Those failing a saving throw vs. poison die immediately; those who make their saving throw are disabled by the choking for 5d4 rounds.

'''Dust of Tracelessness:''' This normal-seeming dust is actually a highly magical powder that can be used to conceal the passage of its possessor and his companions. Tossinga pinch of this dust into the air causes a chamber of up to 1,000 square feet to become as dusty, dirty, and cobweb-laden as if it had been abandoned and disused for a decade.

A pinch of dust sprinkled along a trail causes evidence of the passage of as many as a dozen men and horses to be obliterated for a mile back into the distance. No magical radiation occurs from the use of this dust. The substance is typically found in a finely sewn pouch containing 1d12 +12 pinches.

'''Efreeti Bottle:''' ‘This item is typically fashioned of brass or bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special seals. A thin stream of smoke is often seen issuing from it. There is a 10% chance that the efreeti will be insane and attack immediately upon being released. There is also a 10% chance that the efreeti of the bottle will only grant three wishes. The other 80% of the time, however, the inhabitant ot the bottle will serve normally (see ''Monstrous Compendium''). When opened, the efreeti issues from the bottle instantly.

'''Eversmoking Bottle:''' This meta) urn is identical to an ''efreeti bottle'' except that it does nothing but smoke. The amount of smoke is very great if the stopper is pulled out, pouring from the bottle and totally obscuring vision in a 50,000-cubic-foot area in one round. Left unstoppered, the bottle will fill another 10,000 cubic feet of space with smoke each round until 120,000 cubic feet of space is fogged. This area remains smoked until the ''eversmoking bottle'' is stoppered. When the bottle is stoppered, smoke dissipates normally. The bottle can be resealed only if a command word is known.

'''Eyes of Charming:''' This item consists of a pair of crystal lenses that fit over the user’s eyes. When in place, the wearer is able to ''charm persons'' merely by meeting their gaze. Those failing a saving throw vs. spell are charmed as per the spell. The user can look at and charm one person per round. Saving throws suffer a ~2 penalty if the wearer has both lenses, or a +2 bonus if he wears only one of a pair of ''eyes of charming''.

'''Eyes of the Eagle:''' These iterns are made of special crystal and fit over the eyes of the wearer. They give vision 100 times greater than normal at distances of 1’ or more (ie., the wearer can see at 2,000’ what a person could normally see at 20’), Wearing only one of the pair causes a character to become dizzy and, in effect, stunned, for one round. Thereafter, one eye must always be covered to avoid this sensation of vertigo.

'''Eyes of Minute Seeing:''' In appearance, ''eyes of minute seeing'' are much like other magical lenses, but they enable the wearer to see 100 times better at distances of 1’ or less. Thus, tiny seams, minute marks, even the impression left from writing can be seen. Secret compartments and hidden joints can be noted and the information acted upon. The effect of wearing just one of these crystals is the same as that given for ''eyes of the eagle''.

'''Eyes of Petrification:''' Totally indistinguishable from any other magical lenses, the effect of donning ''eyes of petrification'' is dramatic: the wearer is instantly turned to stone. Note that 25% of these devices work as the gaze of a basilisk does, including reflection of the eyes turning the gazer to stone.

'''Figurines of Wondrous Power:''' There are several kinds of ''figurines of wondrous power''. Each appears to be a tiny statuette of an animal an inch or so high. When the figurine is tossed down and a command word spoken, it becomes a living animal of normal size (except when noted below). The animal obeys and serves its owner.

If a ''figurine of wondrous power'' is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined, all magic is lost, and it has no power, If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette and can be used again at a later time.

When a figurine is first found, roll percentile dice and consult the table below to determine the type of animal the figurine becomes:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D100 Roll
	! Figurine Type
	|-
	| 01-15

	|-
	| 16-30

	| Obsidian steed
	|-
	| 66-85
	| Onyx dog
	|-
	| 86-00
	| Serpentine owl
|}
''Ebony Fly:'' At a word, this small, carved fly comes to life and grows to the size of a pony. The ''ebony fly'' is Armor Class 4, has 4 + 4 Hit Dice, and maneuverability class C. It flies at a movement rate of 48 without a rider, 36 carrying up to 210 pounds weight, and 24 carrying from 211 to 350 pounds weight. The item can be used a maximum of three times per week, 12 hours per day. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the ''ebony fly'' once again becomes a tiny statuette.

''Golden Lions:'' These come in pairs. They become normal adult male lions (Armor Class 5/6, 5 + 2 Hit Dice, and normal attack modes). If slain in combat, the lions cannot be brought back from statuette form for one full week; otherwise, they can be used once every day. They enlarge and shrink upon speaking the command word.

''Ivory Goats:'' These come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different function. These are:
* The Goat of Traveling—This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount of Armor Class 6, with 24 Hit Points and 2 attacks (horns) for 1d8 each (consider as 4 Hit Dice monster). Its movement rate is 48 bearing 280 pounds or less, Its movernent is reduced by 1 for every additional 14 pounds of weight carried. The goat can travel a maximum of one day each week—continuously or in any combination of periods totalling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, returns to its small form for not less a one day before it can again be used,
* The Goat of Travail—When commanded, this statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with sharp hooves (2d4 +2/2d4 +2), a vicious bite (2d4), and a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (2d6/2d6). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns, but +6 damage is added to each hit on that round (i.e., 818 hit points damage per horn). It is Armor Class 0, has 96 hit points, and attacks as a 16-HitDice monster. It can be called to life just once per month up to 12 hours at a time, Its movement rate is 24.
* The Goat of Terror—When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount, movement rate 36, Armor Class 2, 48 hit points, and no attacks. However, its rider ean employ the goat’s horns as weapons (one horn as a spear +3 (lance), the other as asword +6). When ridden versus an opponent, the goat of terror radiates terror in a 30’ radius, and any opponent in this radius must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or lose 50% of strength and suffer at least a -3 penalty to attack rolls, all due to weakness caused by terror. When all opponents are slain, or upon the proper command, the goat returns to its statuette form, lt can be used once every two weeks.

After three uses, each of the goats loses its magical abilities forever.

''Marble Elephant:'' This is the largest of the figurines, the statuette being about the size of a human hand, Upon utterance of the command word, a ''marble elephant'' grows to the size and specifications of a true elephant. The animal created from the statuette is fully obedient to the figurine’s owner, serving as a beast of burden, mount, or combatant. The type of ''marble elephant'' obtained is determined by rolling percentile dice and consulting the table below:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D100 Roll
	! Elephant Type
	|-
	| 01-90
	! Normal Elephant
	|-
	| 91-00
	| Prehistoric Elephant
|}

Details of each type of creature are found in the ''Monstrous Compendium''. The statuette can be used a maximum of 24 hours at a time, four times per month.

''Obsidian Steed:'' An obsidian steed appears to be a small, nearly shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection will reveal that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped, and of course, if magic is detected for, the figurine will radiate magic. Upon speaking thecommand word, the near formless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy war horse with the following additional powers: ''fly'' (at normal movement speed), go ethereal, go astral. [t will allow itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, it is 10% likely per use to carry its “master” to the floor of Hades’ first layer and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used for a 24-hour period maximum, once per week. Note that when the obsidian steed becomes astral or ethereal, its rider and gear follow suit. Thus, travel to other planes can be accomplished by means of this item.

''Onyx Dog:'' When commanded, this statuette changes into a creature with the same properties as a war dog, except that it is endowed with Intelligence of 8-10, can communicate in the Common tongue, and has exceptional olfactory and visual abilities. The olfactory power enables the onyx dog to scent the trail of a known creature 100% of the time if the trail is one hour old or less, -10% per hour thereafter. The dog is subject to being thrown off by false trails, breaks, water, and masking or blocking substances or scents. The visual power enables the ''onyx dog'' to use 90-foot-range infravision, spotting hidden (such as in shadows) things 80% of the time, normally invisible things 65% of the time, and noting astral, ethereal, and out-ol-phase things 50% of the time. For details, see “Dog, War” in the ''Monstrous Compendium'', An ''onyx dog'' can be used for up to six continuous hours, once per week. It obeys only its owner.

''Serpentine Owl:'' A ''serpentine owl'' becomes a normal-sized horned owl (AC 7; move 24; 2d2 hit points; 1d2/1d2 points of damage when attacking) if its possessor so commands, or it can become a giant ow! if its owner so requires. The maximum duration of the transforMiscellaneous Magic (Flask of Curses) mation is eight hours in either case. (However, after three transformations into giant owl form, the statuette loses all of its magical properties.) The normal-sized form of the magical statuette moves with 95% silence, has infravision to 90 feet, can see in normal, aboveground darkness as if it were full light, and twice as well as a human. Its hearing is so keen it can detect a mouse moving up to 60’ away. Anyone or anything trying to move silently has his (or its) chances reduced 50% against the ''serpentine owl'' in smaller form. Furthermore, the ow! can and will communicate with its owner by telepathic means, informing him of all it sees and hears within the limitations of its intelligence. If commanded to giant-size, a ''serpentine owl'' is in all respects the same as a giant owl. For information see “Owl, Giant”, in the ''Monstrous Compendium''. As with most other ''figurines of wondrous power'', this one readily obeys all commands of its owner.

'''Flask of Curses:''' This item looks like an ordinary beaker, bottle, container, decanter, flask, or jug. It has magical properties, but detection will not reveal the nature of the ''flask of curses''. It may contain a liquid or it may emit smoke, When the flask is first unstoppered, a ''curse'' of some sort will be visited upon the person or persons nearby. After that, it is harmless. The type of ''curse'' is up to the DM. Suggestions include the reverse of the priest’s ''bless'' spell. Typical curses found on scrolls are recommended for use here as well, Or perhaps a monster could appear and attack all creatures in sight.

'''Gauntlets of Dexterity:''' A pair of these gloves appears to be nothing more than lightweight leather handwear of the everyday sort. Naturally, they radiate magic if so detected. They size themselves magically to fit any hand, from that of a huge human to that of a small halfling. ''Gauntlets of Dexterity'' increase overall Dexterity by 4 points if the wearer’s Dexterity is 6 or less, by 2 points if at 7-13, and by 1 point if Dexterity is 14 or higher. Furthermore, wearing these gloves enables a non-thief character to pick pockets (45% chance) or open locks (37% chance) as if he were a 4th-level thief. If worn by a thief, they increase these two abilities by 10%.

'''Gauntlets of Fumbling:''' These gauntlets may be of supple leather or heavy protective material suitable for use with armor (ring, scale, chain, etc.). In the former instance, these will appear to be ''gauntlets of dexterity''; in the latter case, they will appear to be ''gauntlets of ogre power''. They will perform according to every test as if they were ''gauntlets of dexterity'' or ''ogre power'' until the wearer finds himself under attack or in a life and death situation. At that time, the curse is activated, and the wearer will become very clumsy, with a 50% chance each round of dropping anything held in either hand—not from both singly. The gauntlets will also lower overall Dexterity by 2 points. Once the curse is activated, the gloves can be removed only by means of a ''remove curse'' spell or a ''wish''.

'''Gauntlets of Ogre Power:''' These appear the same as typical handwear for armor. The wearer of these gloves, however, is imbued with 18/00 Strength in his hands, arms, and shoulders. When striking with the hand or with a weapon hurled or held, the gauntlets add a +3 bonus to attack rolls anda +6 bonus to damage inflicted when a hit is made, These gauntlets are particularly desirable when combined with a ''girdle of giant strength'' and a hurled weapon. They grow or shrink to fit human to halfling-sized hands.

'''Gauntlets of Swimming and Climbing:''' A pair of these gloves appear to be normal lightweight handwear, but they radiate magic if a detection is attempted. The wearer can have hands of large (human) or small (halfling) size. The wearer can swim as fast as a triton (movement of 15) underwater, and as fast as a merman (movement 18) on the surface. These gauntlets do not empower the wearer to breathe in water.

These gloves give the wearer a very strong gripping ability with respect to climbing. He can climb vertical or nearly vertical surfaces, upward or downward, with a 95% chance of success. If the wearer is a thief, the gauntlets increase success probability to 99%.

'''Gem of Brightness:''' This crystal appears to be a long, rough prism, Upon utterance of the proper spell words, however, the crystal emits bright light of one of three sorts.

One command word causes the germ to shed a pale light in a cone-shape 10’ long, emanating from the gem to a radius of 2½’ at the end of the beam. This does not discharge any of the energy of the device.

Another command causes the ''gem of brightness'' to send out a very bright ray 1’ in diameter and 50’ long, Any creature struck in the eyes by this beam will be dazzled and unable to see for 1d4 rounds. The target creature is entitled to a saving throw versus magic to determine whether or not its eyes were shut or averted in time. This use of the gem expends one energy charge.

The third manner in which the item may be used is to cause it to flare in a blinding flash of light in a cone 30’ long with a 5’ radius at its end. Although this glare lasts but a moment, all creatures within its area must save versus magic or be blinded for 1-4 rounds and thereafter suffer a penalty of -1 to -4 to attack rolls due to permanent eye damage. This use expends five charges.

Dazzling or blindness effects can be reversed by a ''cure blindness'' spell; eye damage can be cured only by a heal spell. The ''gem of brightness'' has 50 charges and cannot be recharged. A ''darkness'' spell cast at the gem’s owner drains one charge from a ''gem of brightness'', or makes it useless for one round, at the option of the gem owner. A ''continual darkness'' spell causes it to be useless for one day, or to expend five charges, at the option of the owner.

'''Gem of Insight:''' This jewel appears to be a well-cut stone of not less than 5,000 gp value. If magic is detected for, the gem radiates a faint aura of the enchantment sort, If any character possesses the item, he will begin to feel its power after keeping the gem on his person for one week, At the end of two weeks, the individual will discover that he is able to understand things more easily, have better insight, memory, recall, etc. In fact, possession of the gem on a continuing basis (three or more months) raises the Intelligence and Wisdom of the character by one point each. It for any reason the gem is not kept beyond the threemonth period, the additional Intelligence remains, but the additional Wisdom is lost. A ''gem of insight'' functions once every 50 years, If a character acquires a second gem, the second item has no effect, even if Wisdom was not permanently affected by the first gem.

'''Gem of Seeing:''' These finely cut and polished stones are indistinguishable from ordinary jewels, although a ''detect magic'' will reveal its enchantment. When gazed through, the ''gem of seeing'' enables the user to detect all hidden, illusionary, invisible, astral, ethereal, or out-of-phase things within viewing range.

Peering through the crystal is time-consuming and tedious. The viewing range of the gem is 300’ for a cursory scan if only large, obvious objects are being sought, 100’ if small things are to be seen. It requires one round to scan a 200-squarefoot area in a cursory manner, two rounds a view a 100-square-foot area in a careful way. There is a 5% chance each time the gem is used that the viewer will see an hallucination, something that is not there, or possibly through some real thing as if it were an illusion.

'''Girdle of Dwarvenkind:''' This belt lowers the wearer’s Charisma score by 1 with respect to non-dwarves and their ilk, The girdle causes the wearer to gain one point of Charisma with respect to halflings of the stout sort and with respect to all gnomes as well. Dwarves regard the wearer as if he has Charisma two points higher than before, The girdle enables the wearer to understand, speak, and read dwarvish language. The wearer also gains the racial benefits of dwarvenkind (i.e., +1 Constitution, saving throw bonuses based on total Constitution, 60’ infravision, and detection/determination of approximate depth underground as described in the ''Players Handbook''). All bonuses and penalties apply only as long as the individual actually wears the girdle. Benefits such as additional languages and combat bonuses against giant-type opponents never apply.

'''Girdle of Femininity/Masculinity:''' This broad leather band appears to be a normal belt, but, if buckled on, it will immediately change the sex of its wearer to the opposite gender. It then loses all power. There is no sure way to restore the character’s original sex, although there is a 50% chance a ''wish'' might do so, and a powerful being can alter the situation. In other words, it takes a god-like creature to set matters aright with certainty. Ten percent of these girdles actually remove all sex from the wearer.

'''Girdle of Giant Strength:''' This belt looks similar to ordinary belts, but it is imbued with very powerful magic. When worn it increases the physical prowess of its wearer, giving him the Strength of a giant. (It doesn’t cause the wearer to grow to giant size, however!) To determine how strong the wearer becomes and the bonuses he gets, roll percentile dice and consult the table below.

The Strength gained is not cumulative with normal or magical Strength bonuses except in combination with ''gauntlets of ogre power'' and magical warhammers.

'''Girdle of Many Pouches:''' This broad waistbelt seems to be nothing more than a well-made article of dress. However, if magic is detected for, the item will radiate strong enchantment along with a fainter aura of alteration.

&#42; The number in parentheses is the number of chances out of 20.for the character to be able to force open a locked, barred, magically held, or ''wizard locked'' door. Only one attempt can be made per door; if it fails, no further attempts can be made.

The wearer of the girdle is able to hurl rocks and bend bars as if he had imbibed a ''potion of giant strength''. These abilities are:

&#42; Approximate average missile weight.

Examination will reveal that the girdle has eight small pouches on its inner front surface. In fact, there are a total of 64 magical pouches in the girdle, seven others “behind” each of the cight apparent ones, Each of these pouches is similar to a miniature ''bag of holding'', able to contain up to one cubic foot of material weighing as much as 10 pounds. The girdle responds to the thoughts of its wearer by providing a full pouch (to extract something from) or an empty one (to put something in) as desired. Naturally, this item is greatly prized by spellcasters, for it will hold components for many spells and make them readily available.

'''Gloves of Missile Snaring:''' These gloves radiate slightly of enchantment and alteration if magic is detected for. Once snugly worn, they seem to meld with the hands, becoming almost invisible (undetectable unless within five feet of the wearer). Either or both hands so clad, if not already holding something, can be used to pick many sorts of missiles out of the air, thus preventing possible harm, and enabling the wearer to return a hand-thrown missile to its sender as an attack in a subsequent round.

All forms of small, hand-hurled or weaponpropelled missiles (arrows, bolts, darts, bullets, javelins, axes, hammers, spears, and the like) can be caught. If the weapon magically returns to the attacker, then catching it simply prevents damage, and returning the weapon does not result in an attack.

'''Harp of Charming:''' This instrument appears identical to all other magical harps. When played by a person proficient in the instrument, the player is able to cast one ''suggestion'' spell each turn of playing. Optionally, the DM can require a successful proficiency check be made to cast the ''suggestion''. On a die roll of 20, the harpist has played so poorly as to enrage all those who hear.

'''Harp of Discord:''' This harp appears normal in all respects, However when played, the harp emits painful and discordant tones 50% of the time. The remaining 50% of the time it acts as a ''harp of charming''. When discordant, the music has the effect of automatically enraging all those within 30 feet. Those enraged will attack the musician 50% of the time or the nearest other target the remaining 50% of the time. The harpist is not affected by this frenzy unless he is being attacked. The frenzy lasts for 1d4 +1 rounds after the music stops.

'''Hat of Disguise:''' This normal-appearing hat contains a powerful enchantment that allows its wearer to alter his appearance as follows:
:Height: +/-25% of actual height
:Weight: +/-50% of actual weight
:Sex: Male or female
:Hair: Any color
:Eyes: Any color
:Complexion: Any color
:Facial features: Highly mutable

Thus, the wearer could appear as a comely woman, a half-orc, or possibly even a gnome. If the hat is removed, the disguise is instantly dispelled. The headgear can be used over and over, Note that the hat can be changed (as partot a disguise) to appear as a comb, ribbon, head band, fillet, cap, coif, hood, helmet, etc.

'''Hat of Stupidity:''' This hat is indistinguishable from any other magical hat, even when most carefully detected by magical means. Only by placing it upon the head can its powers be determined. Of course, once on the head, the wearer will believe that the hat is a beneficial item, for he will be overcome by stupidity. Intelligence is lowered to 7, or by -1 if the wearer has a7 or lower Intelligence normally. The wearer will always desire to have the hat on—especially when he is engaged in any activity which requires thinking, spellcasting, etc. Without the benefit of a ''remove curse'' spell or similar magic, the wearer will never be free from the magic of the hat. If released, the wearer’s Intelligence returns to its normal level.

'''Helm of Brilliance:'''’  When discovered, a ''helm of brilliance'' appears to be nothing more than an ordinary piece of armor for head protection—a helmet, basinet, sallet, etc, of iron or steel. When worn, it functions only upon the utterance of a special command word. When so empowered the true nature of the helm is visible to all. The helm is armor of +2 value. It is of brilliant silver and polished steel, and set with 10 diamonds, 20 rubies, 30 fire opals, and 40 opals—each of large size and magicked—which perform as explained below. When struck by bright light, the helm will scintillate and send forth reflective rays in all directions from its crown-like, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels’ functions are:
{| class="wikitable"
	| Diamond
	| Prismatic spray (as the 7th-level wizard spell)
	|-
	| Ruby
	| Wall of fire (as the Sth-level priest spell)
	|-
	| Fire Opal
	| Fireball (as the 3rd-level wizard spell)
	|-
	| Opal
	| Light (as the Ist-level priest spell)
|}
Each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. The helm may be used once per round. The level of the spell is doubled to obtain the level at which the spell was cast with respect to range, duration, and such considerations. Until all of its jewels are magically expended, a ''helm of brilliance'' also has the following magical properties when activated:
# It glows with a bluish light when undead are within 30”. This light causes pain and 1d6 points of damage to all such creatures except skeletons and zombies.
# The wearer may command any sword he wields to become a ''sword of flame''. This is in addition to any other special properties it may have. This takes one round to take effect,
# The wearer may ''produce flame'' just as if he were a 5th-level druid.
# The wearer is protected as if a doublestrength ''fire resistance ring'' were worn, but this protection cannot be augmented by further magical means. Once all of its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses all of its powers. The gems turn to worthless powder when this occurs. Removing a jewel destroys the gem. They may not be recharged.

If a creature wearing the helm is attacked by magical tire and fails to save vs. magical fire, he must attempt another saving throw for the helmet without magical additions. If this is tailed, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate, inflicting on the wearer whatever accumulated eftects the gems would normally have.

'''Helm of Comprehending Languages and Magic:''' Appearing as a normal helmet, ''a helm of comprehending languages and reading magic'' enables its wearer to understand 90% of strange tongues and writings and 80% of magical writings. (Note that these percentage figures apply to whether all or none of the speaking/writing or inscription is understandable. Understanding does not necessarily imply spell use.) This device is equal to a normal helmet of the type accompanying Armor Class 5,

'''Helm of Opposite Alignment:''' This metal hat looks like a typical helmet. If magic is detected for, it radiates magic of an indeterminate sort. Once placed upon the head, however, its curse immediately takes effect, and the alignment of the wearer is radically altered—good to evil, neutral to some absolute commitment (LE, LG, CE, CG) as radically different from the former alignment as possible. Alteration in alignment is mental and, once effected, is desired by the individual changed by the magic.

Only a ''wish'' can restore former alignment, and the affected individual will not make any attempt to return to the former alignment. If a paladin is concerned, he must undergo a special quest and atone if the curse is to be obliterated. Note that once a ''helm of opposite alignment'' has functioned, it loses all of its magical properties.

'''Helm of Telepathy:''' This sturdy metal helmet appears to be a normal piece of headgear, although it will radiate magic if this is detected for. The wearer of a ''helm of telepathy'' is able to determine the thoughts of creatures within a 60’ range. There are two limitations on this power: The wearer must know the language used by such creatures (the racial tongue will be used in thoughts in preference to the Common, the Common in preference to alignment languages); and there can’t be more than 3’ of solid stone, ¼’ of iron, or any solid sheeting of lead or gold between the wearer and the creatures.

The thought pick-up is directional. Conscious eftort must be made to pick up thoughts, The wearer may communicate by language with any creature within ‘range if there is a mutually known speech, or emotions may be transmitted (empathy) so that a creature will receive the emotional message of the wearer.

If the wearer of the helm wants to implant a ''suggestion'' (see the 3rd-level wizard spell of that name in the ''Player’s Handbook''), he can attempt to do so as follows: The creature receiving the ''suggestion'' gains a saving throw vs. spell with a —1 penalty for every two points of Intelligence lower than the telepathist, but a +1 bonus for every point of Intelligence higher than the wearer of the helm. If Intelligence is equal, no adjustment is made when the saving throw is rolled,

'''Helm of Teleportation:''' This is another helmet of normal appearance which will give off a magical aura if detected for. Any character wearing this device may ''teleport'' once per day, exactly as if he werea wizard—the destination must be known, and a risk is involved. If the wearer is a wizard, the helm’s full powers can be employed, for the wearer can then memorize a ''teleportation'' spell, and use the helm to refresh his memory so he can repeat the spell up to three times upon objects or characters and still be able to personally ''teleport'' by means of the helm. As long as the wizard retains the ''teleportation'' spell uncast, he can personally ''teleport'' up to six times before the memory of the spell is lost, and even then a usage of the helm remains as noted above for all characters.

'''Helm of Underwater Action:''' When this helm is viewed, it is indistinguishable from a normal helmet. However, detection reveals it to be magical, and the possessor is able to see and breathe underwater. Visual properties of the helm are activated when small lenses are drawn across the device from compartments on either side. These allow the wearer to see five times farther than water and light conditions allow for normal human vision. (Note that weeds, obstructions, and the like block vision in the usual manner.) If the command word is spoken, the ''helm of underwater action'' creates a globe of air around the wearer’s head, and maintains it until the command word is spoken again. Thus, the wearer can breathe freely.

'''Heward’s Handy Haversack:''' A magical backpack of this sort appears quite ordinary—wellmade and well-used. It is of finely tanned leather, and the straps have brass hardware and buckles. There are two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material, but each is similar to a ''bag of holding'' and will actually contain material equal to as much as two cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to eight cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The pack has an even greater power: When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item will always be on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what the haversack contains. ''Heward’s handy haversack'' and whatever it contains gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws.

'''Horn of Blasting:''' This magical horn appears to be a normal trumpet, but it radiates magic if a ''detect magic'' is cast upon it. It can be sounded as a normal horn, but if the correct word is spoken and the instrument is then played, it has the following effects, both of which happen at once:
# A cone of sound, 120’ long and 30° wide at the end, issues forth from the horn. All within this area must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell. Those saving are stunned for one round and deafened for two. Those failing the saving throw sustain 1d10 points of damage, are stunned for two rounds, and deafened for four.
# A wave of ultrasonic sound 1’ wide and 100’ long issues from the horn. This causes a weakening of such materials as metal, stone,es and wood. The weakening is equal in effect to the damage caused by a hit from a missile hurled by a large catapult. See “Siege Damage,” page 76 and suffer an additional -2 penalty to the die roll described there.

If a ''horn of blasting'' is used magically more than once per day, there is a 10% cumulative chance that it will explode and inflict 5d10 points of damage upon the person sounding it.

There are no charges upon a horn, but the device is subject to stresses as noted above, and each time it is used to magical effect there is a 2% cumulative chance of the instrument self-destructing. In the latter case, no damage is inflicted on the character blowing it.

'''Horn of Bubbles:''' This cursed musical instrument will radiate magic if detected for. It appears as a normal horn, or possibly any of the many magical ones. |t will sound a note and call forth a mass of bubbles that completely surround and blind the individual who blew the horn for 2d10 rounds, but these bubbles appear only in the presence of a creature actively seeking to slay the character who played the horn, so their appearance might be delayed for a very short or extremely lengthy period.

'''Horn of Collapsing:''' The horn appears to be a normal musical instrument, perhaps a bugle or warning horn of some sort. If it is sounded improperly (e.g., without first speaking the proper command word) or 10% of the time in any event, the following will result:

''Out-of-doors:'' A torrent of fist-sized rocks will strike the individual sounding the horn, 2d6 in number, each causing 1d6 hit points of damage.

''Indoors:'' The ceiling overhead will collapse when the device is blown, The character suffers 3d12 points of damage.

''Underground:'' The area immediately above the character sounding the horn will fall upon him. The damage is 5d4 points base, multiplied by one for each 10’ of height which the material above drops (i.e., twice damage if a 20’ ceiling, three times damage if a 30’ ceiling, etc.).

Proper use of a ''horn of collapsing'' enables the character to sound it while it is pointed at the roof overhead from 30’ to 60’ beyond the user. The effect is to collapse a section of roof up to 20° wide and 20’ long (10’ radius from the central aiming point) which inflicts damage as noted above if indoors or underground only.

'''Horn of Fog:''' This small, buglelike device allows its possessor to blow forth a thick cloud of heavy fog equal to that of a ''fog cloud'' spell. Each round spent blowing it creates a 10-cubic-foot fog cloud. The cloud lasts for 2d4 rounds after the last round of blowing the instrument. Note that should it stop being sounded for a round, a new ''fog cloud'' will have begun, as the initial one has a life expectancy of but 2d4 more minutes, and will have drifted away from the individual sounding it. The device makes a deep, horn-like noise, the note dropping abruptly to a lower register at the end.

'''Horn of Goodness/Evil:''' This magical instrument adapts itself to the alignment of its possessor, so it will produce either a good or an evil effect depending on the alignment of its owner, If the possessor is absolutely neutral, the horn will have no power whatsoever. If the owner is good, then blowing the horn has the effect of a ''protection from evil'' spell in a 10’ radius, and this protection will last for 10 rounds. Each friendly/allied creature within this area will be affected as if granted the spell. If the horn is of evil alignment, then the reverse of the noted spell occurs within the area of effect. The horn can be blown once per day.

'''Horn of the Tritons:''' This device is a conchshell horn which can be blown once per day (except by a triton who can sound it three times daily). A ''horn of the tritons'' can do any one of the following functions when blown:
# Calm rough waters in a one mile radius. (This has the effect of dispelling a water elemental or water weird.)
# Summon 5d4 hippocampi (on a dé6 roll of 1 or 2), 5d6 giant sea horses (on a roll of 3-5), or 1d10 sea lions (on a roll of 6) if the character is in a body of water in which such creasures dwell, The creatures summoned will be friendly and will obey, to the best of their understanding, the character who sounded the horn.
# Panic marine creatures with animal or lower Intelligence, causing them to flee unless each saves vs. spell. Those who do save must take a —5 penalty on their attack rolls for 3d6 turns (30-180 rounds).

Any sounding of a ''horn of the tritons'' can be heard by all tritons within a three mile radius.

'''Horn of Valhaila:''' There are four varieties of this magical device. Each appears to be a normal instrument until its command word is spoken. Then, each summons a number of berserkers from Valhalla to fight for the character who summoned them by blowing the horn. Each variety of horn can be blown just once every seven days. The type of horn, its powers, and who is able to employ it are determined by rolling 1420 and consulting the table below.

Any character whose group is unable to employ a particular ''horn of Valhalla'' will be attacked by the berserk fighters summoned when the character blows the horn.

Summoned fighters are Armor Class 4, have 6 hit points per die, and are armed with sword and spear (50%), or battle-axe and spear (SO%). They gladly attack anyone the possessor of the horn commands them to fight, until they or their opponents are slain, or six turns have elapsed, whichever occurs first.

Fully 50% of these horns are aligned and will summon only fighters of the horn''s alignment. A radical alignment difference will cause the horn blower to be attacked by the fighters.

'''Horseshoes of Speed:''' These iron shoes come in sets of four like ordinary horseshoes, but they are magical and will not wear out. When affixed to a horse’s hooves, they double the animal’s speed, There is a 1% chance per 20 miles traveled that a shoe will drop off, and if this passes unnoticed, the horse’s speed will drop to 150% normal rate. If two or more are lost, speed returns to normal.

'''Horseshoes of a Zephyr:''' These iron shoes can be affixed like normal horseshoes, but they allow a horse to travel without actually touching the ground. Among other things, this means water can be crossed—passed over without effort—and movement is possible without leaving tracks on any sort of ground, The horse is able to move at normal speeds and it will not tire for as long as 12 hours’ continuous riding per day when wearing these magical horseshoes.

'''Incense of Meditation:''' The small rectangular blocks of sweet-smelling ''incense of meditation'' are indistinguishable from non-magical incense until one is lit. When burning, the special fragrance and pearly-hued smoke of this special incense are recognizable by any priest of 5th or higher level.

When a priest lights a block of the incense of meditation and spends eight hours praying and meditating nearby, the incense will enable him to gain maximum spell effects. Thus, ''cure wounds'' spells are always maximum, spell effects are of the broadest area possible, and saving throws against their effects suffer -1 penalties, and when dead are brought back to life, their chance of not surviving is reduced by one-half (rounded down).

When this itern of magic is discovered, there will be 2d4 pieces of incense. Each piece burns for eight hours; the effects remain for 24 hours.

'''Incense of Obsession:''' These strange blocks of incense exactly resemble ''incense of meditation''. If meditation and prayer are conducted while the lit ''incense of obsession'' is nearby, its odor and smoke will cause the priest to become totally confident that his spell ability is superior, due to the magical incense. The priest will be determined to use his spells at every opportunity, even when not needed or when useless, The priest will remain obsessed with his abilities and spells until all are cast or 24 hours have elapsed.

There are 2d4 pieces of this incense normally, each burning for one hour.

'''Ioun Stones:''' These magical stones always float in the air and must be within 3’ of their owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires the stones, he must hold each and then release it, so it takes up a circling orbit, whirling and trailing, circling 1d3 feet from his head. Thereafter, the stones must be grasped or netted to separate them from their owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow the stones (at night, for example) to keep them safe, but he loses the benefits of the stones during that time. 1d10 joun stones will be found, though there are 14 different kinds, in all. Roll 1d20 to determine the property of each stone, a duplication indicating a stone which is burned out and useless but counts as one of the number found:

Whenever ioun stones are exposed to attack, they are treated as Armor Class -4 and take 10 hit points of damage to destroy. They save as if they were of hard metal— +3 bonus.

'''Iron Bands of Bilarro:''' When initially discovered, this very potent item will appear to be a rusty iron sphere. Close examination will reveal that there are bandings on the threeinch-diameter globe. Magic detection will reveal strong magic of an indeterminate nature.

When the proper command word is spoken and the spherical iron device is hurled at an opponent, the bands expand and tightly constrict the target creature if a successful, unadjusted attack roll is made. A single creature of up to frost/fire giant-size can be captured thus and held immobile until the command word is spoken to bring the bands into globular form again. Any creature captured in the bands, however, gets the chance to break (and ruin) the bands by successfully ''bending bars''. Only one attempt is possible before the bands are so set as to be inescapable.

'''Iron Flask:''' These special containers are typically inlaid with runes of silver and stoppered by a brass plug bearing a seal set round with sigils, glyphs, and special symbols. When the user speaks a command, he can force any creature from another plane into the container, provided the creature fails its saving throw vs. spell—after magic resistance, if any, is checked. Range is 60’. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. Loosing the stopper frees the captured creature.

If the individual freeing the captured creature knows the command word, the creature can be forced to serve for one turn (or to perform a minor service which takes up to one hour). If freed without command knowledge, dice for the creature’s reaction. Any attempt to force the same creature into the flask a second time allows it +2 on its saving throw and makes it ''very'' angry and totally hostile. A discovered bottle might contain:

'''Jewel of Attacks:''' This gleaming gem radiates magic and appears to be a valuable item, It is cursed, however, and doubles the likelihood of encountering wandering monsters and the likelihood of pursuit when monsters are encountered and the party seeks to evade them by flight. Once picked up, the ''jewel of attacks'' will always magically return to its finder (secreting itself in pouch, bag, pack, pocket, etc.) until a ''remove curse'' spell or an ''atonement'' is cast upon him.

'''Jewel of Flawlessness:''' This magical gem appears to be a very fine stone of some sort, but if magic is detected for, its magical aura will be noted. When a ''jewel of flawlessness'' is placed with other gems, it doubles the likelihood of their being more valuable (i.e., the chance for each stone going up in value increases from 10% to 20%). The jewel has from 10-100 facets, and whenever a gem increases in value because of the magic of the ''jewel of flawlessness'' (a roll of 2 on d10), one of these facets disappears. When all are gone, the jewel is a spherical stone that has no value.

'''Keoghtom’s Ointment:''' This sovereign salve is useful for drawing poison, curing disease, or healing wounds. A jar of the unguent is small—perhaps three inches in diameter and one inch deep—but contains five applications. Placed upon a poisoned wound (or swallowed), it detoxifies any poison or disease. Rubbed on the body, the ointment heals 1d4 +8 points of damage. Generally, 1d3 jars will be found.

'''Lens of Detection:''' This circular prism enables its user to detect minute things at 50% of the ability of ''eyes of minute seeing'', but it also enables the possessor to look through the lens and track as a Sth-level ranger does, The ''lens of detection'' is about six inches in diameter. It must be set in a frame with a handle in order to be properly used.

'''Libram of Gainful Conjuration:''' This mystic book contains much arcane knowledge for wizards of neutral, chaotic neutral, and lawful neutral alignment. If a character of this class and alignment spends a full week cloistered and undisturbed, pondering its contents, he gains experience points sufficient to place him exactly at the mid-point of the next higher level. When this occurs, the libram disappears—totally gone—and that character can never benefit again from reading such a work.

Any non-neutral wizard reading so much as a line of the libram suffers 5d4 points of damage, falls unconscious for a like number of turns, and must seek a priest in order to atone and regain the ability to progress in experience (until doing so, he gains no further experience).

Any non-wizard perusing the work must roll a saving throw vs. spell in order to avoid insanity. Characters who go insane can be healed only by a ''remove curse'' and rest for 1 month or by having a priest ''heal'' them.

'''Libram of Ineffable Damnation:''' This work is exactly like the ''libram of gainful conjuration'' except that it benefits evil wizards. Non-evil characters of that class lose one level of experience merely by looking inside its brass-bound covers, in addition to the other ill effects of perusing as little as one line of its contents.

'''Libram of Silver Magic:''' This mystic text is the reverse of the ''libram of ineffable damnation'', It is greatly beneficial to good wizards, most baneful to non-good ones. Like all magical works of this sort, it vanishes after one week of study, and the character having benefited from it can never be so aided again,

'''Lyre of Building:''' The enchantments placed upon this instrument make it indistinguishable from a normal one. Even if its magic is detected, it cannot be told from an ordinary instrument until it is played. If the proper chords are struck, a single use of the lyre will negate the effects of a ''horn of blasting'', a ''disintegrate'' spell, or the effects of up to three rounds of attack from a ram or similar siege item. The lyre can be used in this way once per day.

The lyre is also useful with respect to actual building. Once a week its strings can be strummed so as to produce chords that magically construct buildings, mines, tunnels, ditches, or whatever. The effect produced in but three turns of playing is equal to the work of 100 men laboring for three days.

A check must be made whenever the lyre is played. Under normal circumstances, a falsechord is sounded on a roll of 1-3 on 1d20. (Characters with the musical instrument proficiency play a false chord only on a roll of 1.) If the player of the lyre is under physical or mental attack, the chance of a false chord increases to 1-10. (Proficient characters resolve a proficiency check by the standard rules under these circumstances.) If a false chord is struck, all effects of the lyre are 20% likely to be negated.

'''Manual of Bodily Health:''' The metal-bound ''manual of bodily health'' appears to be an arcane, rare, but non-magical book. If a ''detect magic'' spell is cast upon it, the manual will radiate an aura of magic. Any character who reads the work (24 hours of time over 3-5 days) will know how to increase his Constitution by one point—this involves a special dietary regimen and breathing exercises over a one-month period. The book disappears immediately upon completion of its contents.

The point of Constitution is gained only after the prescribed regimen is followed. In three months the knowledge of the secrets to bodily health will be forgotten, The knowledge cannot be articulated or recorded by the reader. The manual will not be useful to any character a second time, nor will more than one character be able to benefit from a single copy.

'''Manual of Gainful Exercise:''' This work is similar to the ''manual of bodily health'', but its reading and prescribed course of action will result in the addition of one point to the reader’s Strength.

'''Manual of Golems:''' This compilation is a treatise on the construction and animation of golems. It contains all of the information and incantations necessary to make one of the four sorts of golems.

The construction and animation of a golem takes a considerable amount of time and costs quite a bit as well. During the construction/animation process, a single wizard or priest must have the manual at hand to study, and he must not be interrupted. The type of manual found is determined by rolling 1d20 and consulting the table below:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D20 Roll
	! Type of Golem
	! Construction Time
	! GP Cost
	|-
	| 1-5
	| Clay (P)
	| 1 month
	| 65,000
	|-
	| 6-17
	| Flesh (W)
	| 2 months
	| 50,000
	|-
	| 18
	| Iron (W)
	| 4 months
	| 100,000
	|-
	| 19-20
	| Stone (W)
	| 3 months
	| 80,000
|}

Once the golem is finished, the writing fades and the book is consumed in flames. When the ashes of the manual are sprinkled upon the golem, the figure becomes fully animated.

It is assumed that the user of the manual is of 10th or higher level. For every level of experience under 10th, there is a cumulative 10% chance that the golem will fall to pieces within one turn of completion due to the maker’s impertect understanding.

If a priest reads a work for wizards, he will lose 10,000-60,000 experience points, A wizard reading a priestly work will lose one level of experience. The DM must decide in advance which it is meant for. Any other class of character will suffer 6d6 hit points of damage from opening the work.

'''Manual of Puissant Skill at Arms:''' This scholarly study contains expert advice and instruction regarding weapon use and various attack and defense modes. Any single bard or fighter (but not a paladin or ranger) who reads the manual and practices the skills described therein for one month goes up to the mid-point of the next higher level. The book disappears after it is read, and the knowledge therein will be forgotten within three months, so it must be acted upon reasonably quickly.

The fighter cannot articulate what he has read, nor can it be recorded in any fashion. Paladins and rangers will understand the work but cannot benefit from reading it. Priests and thieves cannot understand the ''manual of puissant skill at arms''. If a wizard so much as scans a few of its letters, he will be stunned for 1d6 turns and lose 10,000-60,000 experience points. A character can benefit from reading a ''manual of puissant skill at arms'' only one time.

'''Manual of Quickness of Action:''' The heavy covers and metal bindings of this compilation will not distinguish it from other semivaluable, nonmagical texts. This work contains secret formulae and prescriptions for unguents and exercises that enable a single reader to assimilate the text (three days of uninterrupted study) and then practice the skills detailed therein.

If this practice is faithfully done for one month, the character will gain one point of Dexterity, The marwual will disappear immediately after reading, but the contents will be remembered for three months. However, the reader will not be able to articulate or otherwise record the information he retains. Only after the month of training will the Dexterity bonus be gained, Further perusal of a similar text will not add to the same character’s Dexterity.

'''Manual of Stealthy Pilfering:''' This is a guide to expertise at thievery. It is so effective that any thief or bard who reads it and then spends one month practicing the skills therein will gain enough experience points to place him at the mid-point of the next higher level. The text disappears after reading, but knowledge is retained for three months. As with other magical texts of this sort, however, the knowledge cannot be recorded or repeated to others. Any additional reading of a similar manual is of no benefit to the character.

Fighters and wizards are unable to comprehend the work. Priests, rangers, and paladins who read even a word of the book suffer 5d4 points of damage, are stunned for a like number of rounds, and, if a saving throw vs. spell is failed, they lose 5,000-20,000 experience points as well, In addition, such characters must atone within one day or lose one point of Wisdom.

'''Mattock of the Titans:''' This huge digging tool is 10’ long and weighs over 100 pounds. Any giant-sized creature with a Strength of 20 or more can use it to loosen (or tumble) earth or earthen ramparts in a 100-cubic-foot area in one turn. It will smash rock in a 20-cubic-foot area in the same amount of time. If used as a weapon, it has a +3 bonus to attack rolls and inflicts 5d6 points of damage, exclusive of Strength bonuses (see ''girdle of giant strength'').

'''Maul of the Titans:''' This huge mallet is 8’ long and weighs over 150 pounds. Any giantsized creature with Strength of 21 or greater can employ it to drive piles of up to 2’ diameter into normal earth at 4° per blow—two blows per round. The maul will smash to flinders an oaken door of up to 10’ height by 4’ width by 2” thickness in one blow—two if the door is heavily bound with iron. [f used as a weapon, it has a #2 bonus to attack rolls and inflicts 4d10 hit points of damage, exclusive of Strength bonuses.

'''Medallion of ESP:''' This appears to be a normal pendant disk hung from a neck chain. It is usually fashioned from bronze, copper, or nickel-silver, The device enables the wearer to concentrate and pick up thoughts in a path 1’ wide at the medallion and broadening 2’ every 10’ from the device the magic reaches, up to an 11’ maximum width at 50’. Note that the wearer cannot send thoughts through a ''medallion of ESP''.

Use of the medallion requires a full round. It is prevented from functioning by stone of over 3’ thickness, metal of over <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub>” thickness, or any continuous sheet of lead, gold or platinum of any thickness greater than paint. The medallion malfunctions (with no result) on a roll of 6 on 1dé6, and the device must be checked each time it is used.

The character using the device can pick up only the surface thoughts of creatures in the ESP path. The general distance can be determined, but all thoughts will be understandable only if the user knows the language of the thinkers. If target creatures use no language, only the prevailing emotions can be felt, Note that undead and mindless golems have neither readable thoughts nor emotions. The type of medallion found is determined by consulting the table below:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D20 Roll
	! Medallion
	|-
	| 1-15
	| 30’ range
	|-
	| 16-18
	| 30’ range with empathy
	|-
	| 19
	| 60’ range
	|-
	| 20
	| 90’ range
|}

'''Medallion of Thought Projection:''' This device is like an ''ESP Medallion'' in every respect, even as to the range at which it functions. However, in addition to picking up the thoughts of creatures, it will broadcast the thoughts of the user to the creatures in the path of the beam, thus alerting them. To prevent projecting thoughts, the user rolls 1d6. On a roll of 6, the thoughts remain a secret.

'''Mirror of Life Trapping:''' This crystal device is usually about 4 square feet in area, framed in metal, wood, etc. It is usable only by wizards, although it can be affixed to a surface to operate alone by giving a command word. A mirror has from 13 to 18 non-spatial/extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30’ of the device and looking at its reflection must successfully save vs. spell or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device will always see its reflection, the probability dropping to 50% if the creature actively avoids doing so, and to 20% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life.

When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but automatons and non-living matter (including golems but excluding intelligent undead) are not trapped. The possessor of the mirror can call the reflection of any creature that is trapped within to the surface of the mirror, and the powerless creature can be engaged in conversation. If mirror capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) will be set free in order to accommodate the latest one.

If the mirror is broken, all victims are freed (usually to then attack the the possessor of the device). Note that the possessor of a ''mirror of life trapping'' can speak a command word to free a trapped creature, but the creature’s cell must be known. Example: “In the name of Zagig the Great, | command the occupant of the third cell to come forth!”

'''Mirror of Mental Prowess:''' This magical mirror resembles an ordinary one 5’ x 2’. The possessor who knows the proper commands can cause it to perform as follows:
# Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, even though these thoughts are in an unknown language.
# Scry with it as if it were a ''crystal ball'' with ''clairaudience'', even being able to view into other planes if the viewer is sufficiently familiar with them.
# Use it as a portal to visit other places (possibly other planes, as well, at the DM’s option) by first scrying them and then stepping through to the place pictured—an invisible area remains on the “other side,” and those using the portal can return if the correct spot can be found. (Note that creatures being scried can step through if the place is found by them!)
# Once per week it will answer one short question regarding a creature whose image is shown upon its surface.

'''Mirror of Opposition:''' This item exactly resembles a normal mirror. If a creature is reflected in its surface, an exact duplicate of the creature will come into being, and this opposite will immediately attack the creature reflected. Note that the duplicate will have all items and powers of the original (including magic), but upon the defeat or destruction of either, the duplicate and his items disappear completely.

'''Murlynd’s Spoon:''' This unremarkable eating utensil is typically fashioned from horn. It radiates a dim aura of conjuration if magic is detected for. If the spoon is placed in an empty container—a bowl, cup, dish, etc.—the vessel will fill with a thick, pasty gruel. Although this substance has a flavor similar to warm, wet cardboard, it is highly nourishing. It contains everything necessary to sustain any herbivorous, Omnivorous, or carnivorous creature. The spoon will produce sufficient gruel each day to feed up to four humans.

'''Necklace of Adaptation:''' This chain resembles a medallion. The wearer can ignore all sorts of gases that affect creatures through respiration. He can also breathe underwater or even exist in airless space for up to seven days.

'''Necklace of Missiles:''' This device appears to be nothing but a cheap medallion or piece of valueless jewelry. If a character places it about his neck, however, he can see the necklace as it really is—it is actually a golden chain from which hang a number of golden missile globes. The spheres are detachable only by the wearer, who can easily hurl them up to 70’ distance. When they arrive at the end of their trajectory, they burst as a magical ''fireball''. The number of missiles, and their respective Hit Dice of ''fireball'' damage, are determined by rolling 1d20 and consulting the table below:
{| class="wikitable"

For example, on a roll of 9-12, the necklace will possess seven missiles—one 7-dice, two 5- dice, and four 3-dice fireballs. The size will show that there is a difference in power between globes, but the number of dice and damage each causes cannot generally be known.

If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails his saving throw versus a magical fire attack, the item must undergo a saving throw check as well. If it fails to save, all remaining missiles detonate simultaneously.

'''Necklace of Prayer Beads:''' A magical necklace of this sort appears to be a normal piece of non-valuable jewelry until it is placed about a
character’s neck. Even then, the true nature of the item will be revealed only if the wearer is a priest (excluding druids and characters otherwise able to use spells of a priestly or druidical nature such as paladins and rangers). The ''necklace of prayer beads'' consists of 1dé+24 semi-precious (60%) and fancy (40%) stones. The wearer will be 25% more likely to successfully petition his deity to grant desired spells. There will also be 1d4+2 special beads (precious stones, gems of 1,000 gp base value) of the following sort (roll 1d20 for each bead):
{| class="wikitable"
	! D20 Roll
	! Results
	|-
	| 1-5
	| Bead of atonement —as the Sthlevel spell of the same name
	|-
	| 6-10
	| Bead of blessing—as the 1st-level spell of the same name
	|-
	| 11-15
	| Bead of curing—cures blindness, disease, or serious wounds (as the appropriate spells)
	|-
	| 16-17
	| Bead of karma—allows the priest to cast his spells as if he were four levels higher (with respect to range, duration, etc.)
	|-
	| 18
	| Bead of summons—calls the priest’s deity (90% probability) to come to him in material form (but it had better be for a good reason!)
	|-
	| 19-20
	| Bead of wind walking—as the 7th-level spell of the same name
|}

Each special bead can be used once per day. If the priest summons his deity frivolously, the deity will, at the very least, take the necklace as punishment. The function of each bead is known only when the bead is grasped and a ''commune'' spell used. All powers of the special beads are lost if they are removed from the necklace.

'''Necklace of Strangulation:''' A necklace of strangulation can be identified only when placed around a character’s neck. The necklace immediately constricts and cannot be removed by any means short of a ''limited wish'' or ''wish'' spell, The wearer suffers 6 points of strangulation damage per round until he is dead. The necklace remains clasped around the character’s throat until he is a dry skeleton. It can be reused.

'''Nolzur’s Marvelous Pigments:''' These magical emulsions enable their possessor to create actual objects simply by depicting their form in two dimensions. The pigments are applied by a stick tipped with bristles, hair, or fur. The emulsion flows from the application to form the desired object as the wielder concentrates on the desired image. One pot of ''Nolzur’s marvelous pigments'' is sufficient to create a 1,000- cubic-foot object by depicting it two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot surface. Thus, a 10’ x 10’ rendition of a pit would result in an actual 10’ x 10’ x 10’ pit; a 10° x 10°
depiction of a room would result in a 10° x 10’ x
10’ room: and so on.

Only normal, inanimate things can be
created—doors, pits, flowers, trees, cells, etc.; monsters, people, golems, and the like can’t be created. The pigments must be applied to a surface (i.e., a floor, wall, ceiling, door, etc.). From 1d4 containers of pigments will be found, usually with a single instrument about
1’ long with which to apply them. It takes one turn to depict an object with pigments. Objects of value depicted by pigments—precious
metals, gems, jewelry, ivory, etc. —will appear to be valuable but will really be made of tin, lead, paste gems, brass, bone, etc. Normal armor or weapons can, of course, be created.

'''Pearl of Power:''' This seemingly normal pear! of average size and coloration is a potent aid to a wizard. Once a day, a ''pearl of power'' enables the possessor to recall any one spell as desired, even if the spell has already been cast. Of course, the wizard must have the spell to be remembered among those he most recently memorized. The power of the pearl is determined by rolling percentile dice and consulting the table below:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D100 Roll
	! Level of Spell Recalled by Pearl
	|-
	| 01-25

|}
One in 20 of these pearls is of opposite effect, causing a spell to be forgotten. These pearls can be gotten rid of only by means of a ''wish''!

'''Pearl of the Sirines:''' This normal-seeming pearl radiates faintly of enchantment if magic is detected for. In any event, the stone will be very beautiful and worth at least 1,000 gp on this basis alone. If it is clasped firmly in hand (or to the breast) and the possessor attempts actions related to the pearl’s power areas, he will understand and be able to employ the item.

The pearl enables its possessor to breathe in water as if he were in clean, fresh air. Underwater movement rate is 24. The possessor is immune to ill effects from the poison touch of a sirine. The pearl must be within the general area of the possessor—less than 10’ distant —to
convey its powers to him.

'''Pearl of Wisdom:''' Although it appears to be a normal pearl, a ''pearl of wisdom'' causes a priest to increase one point in Wisdom if he retains the pearl for one month. The increase happens at the end of 30 days, but thereafter the priest must keep the pearl with him or the one point gain will be lost.

Note that one in 20 of these magical pearls is cursed to work in reverse, but once the point of Wisdom is lost, the pearl turns to powder; the loss is permanent barring some magical restoration means such as a ''wish'' or ''tome of understanding''.

'''Periapt of Foul Rotting:''' This engraved gem appears to be agem of small value. If any character claims it as his own, he will contract a terrible rotting disease which can be removed only by application of a ''remove curse'' spell followed by a ''cure disease'' and then a ''heal'', ''limited wish'' or ''wish'' spell. The rotting can also be countered by crushing a ''periapt of health'' and sprinkling its dust upon the afflicted character. Otherwise, the afflicted loses one point each of Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma per week beginning one week after claiming the item, When any score reaches 0, the character is dead. Each point lost due to the disease will be permanent regardless of subsequent removal of the affliction.

'''Periapt of Health:''' This gem appears exactly the same as a ''periapt of foul rotting'', but the possessor will be immune from all diseases save that of the latter periapt so long as he has it on his person.

'''Periapt of Proof Against Poison:''' The ''periapt of proof against poison'' is indistinguishable from other periapts. The character who has one of these magical gems is alloweda saving throw vs. poison that normally disallow any such opportunity. The Special Save column on the table below lists the saving throw for such poisons. The owner rolls against his normal score for poisons which are usually at a penalty, and gets a plus on all other poison saves. Roll 1d20 and consult the table below to determine the effectiveness of a particular periapt:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D20 Roll
	! Special Save
	! Plus of Periapt
	|-
	| 1-8
	| 19

	| 15-18
	| 15
	| +3
	|-
	| 19-20
	| 13
	| +4
|}

'''Periapt of Wound Closure:''' This magical stone looks exactly the same as the others of this ilk. The person possessing it need never fear open, bleeding wounds because the periapt prevents them. In addition, the periapt doubles the normal rate of healing, or allows normal healing of wounds that would not do so normally.

'''Philosopher’s Stone:''' This is a rare and magical substance that appears to be an ordinary, sooty black piece of rock. It radiates faintly of unknown magic. If the stone is broken open, a cavity will be discovered. The interior of this cavity is lined with a quicksilver which enables the transmutation of the base metals (iron and
\ead) into silver and gold. A wizard will be required to bring about such transmutation, however.

From 50 to 500 pounds of iron can be made into silver; from 10 to 100 pounds of lead can be turned into gold from a single ''philosopher’s
stone''. Transmutation must be made fully upon the first atternpt, all the quicksilver being employed at one time. Two other substances may be found in a ''philosophers stone'' instead of the quicksilver described above, at the DM’s discretion. If he decides there’s something different in the stone, there is a 75% chance that a greenish, crystalline salt will be found. This allows the manufacture of 1d4 potions of longevity. There isa 25% chance that a white powder will be found in a stone. When mixed with a ''potion of longevity'', this can actually restore life to a dead human or demihuman. The mixture must be administered internally within one week of the creature’s demise (see the ''raise dead'' spell).

'''Phylactery of Faithfulness:''' There is no means to determine what function this device performs until it is worn, The wearer of a ''phylactery of faithfulness'' will be aware of any action or item that will adversely affect his alignment and standing with his deity. He acquires this information prior to performing the action or becoming associated with such an item, if a moment is taken to contemplate the action. The phylactery must be worn normally by the priest, of course.

'''Phylactery of Long Years:''' This device slows the aging process by one-quarter for as long as the priest wears it. The reduction applies even to magical aging. Thus, if a priest dons the phylactery at age 20, he will age nine months in every 12 that pass; in 12 chronological years, he will have aged just nine years, and will be 29 (physically) rather than 32, One in 20 of these devices is cursed to operate in reverse.

'''Phylactery of Monstrous Attention:''' While this arm wrapping appears to be a beneficial device, it actually draws the attention of supernatural creatures of exactly the opposite alignment of the priest wearing it. This results in the priest being plagued by powerful and hostile creatures whenever he is in an area where such creatures are or can appear. If the priest is of 10th or higher level, the attention of his deity’s
most powerful enemy will be drawn, causing this being to interfere directly. Once donned, a ''phylactery of monstrous attention'' cannot be removed without a ''wish'' spell and then a quest must be performed to re-establish the priest in his alignment.

'''Pipes of Haunting:''' This magical item appears to be a small set of pan pipes. If checked, it faintly radiates magic. When played by a person skilled in music, the pipes create an eerie, spell-binding tune. A listener will think the source of the music is somewhere within 30 feet of the musician. Those hearing the tune and not aware of the piper must make a saving throw vs. spell. Those who fail become nervous and scared. All morale checks are made with a -2 penalty and the listeners suffer a -1 penalty to all surprise rolls.

'''Pipes of Pain:''' These appear to be like any other standard or magical set of pipes with nothing to reveal their true nature. WhenMiscellaneous Magic (Pipes)
played by a character proficient in music, the pipes create a wondrous melody, surpassing any sound ever heard. All within 30 feet, including the piper, must save vs. spells or be enchanted by the sound. So long as the pipes are played, no one will attack or attempt any action if affected.

As soon as the piping stops, all those affected will be stricken by intense pain at even the slightest noise, causing 1d4 points of damage per round. This pain will last for 2d4 rounds. Thereafter, the least noise will cause the victim to wince, reducing the character’s attack and saving throw rolls —2. The effect can be negated only by a ''forget'' or ''remove curse'' spell.

'''Pipes of Sounding:''' When played by a character proficient in music, these pipes can be used to create a variety of sounds. To alistener the source of the sound will seem to be anywhere within 60 feet of the piper. The possible sounds that can be created are: wind blowing, laughter, whistling, bird calls, moaning, footsteps, crying, mumbled voices, screams, running water, or creaking. (Note: The DM can rule that other similar sounds are possible.)

'''Pipes of the Sewers:''' These wooden pipes appear ordinary, but if the possessor learns the proper tune, he can attract from 10-60 (1d6 x 10) giant rats (80%) or 30-180 (3d6 x 10) normal rats (20%) if either or both are within 400°. For each 50‘ distance the rats have to travel, there will be a one-round delay. The piper must continue playing until the rats appear, and when they do so, they are 95% likely to obey the piper so long as he continues to play. If for any reason the piper ceases playing, the rats summoned will leave immediately. If they are called again, it is 70% probable that they will come and obey, 30% likely that they will turn upon the piper.

If the rats are under control of a creature such as a vampire, the piper''s chance of taking over control is 30% per round of piping. Once control is assumed, there is a 70% chance of maintaining it if the other creature is actively seeking to reassert its control.

'''Portable Hole:''' A portable hole is a circle of magical cloth spun from the webs of a phase spider interwoven with strands of ether and beams of Astral plane luminaries. When opened fully, a portable hole is 6’ in diameter, but it can be folded as small as a pocket handkerchief, When spread upon any surface, it causes an extra~dimensional hole 10’ deep to come into being. This hole can be “picked up”
from inside or out by simply taking hold of the edges of the magical cloth and folding it up. Either way, the entrance disappears, but anything inside the hole rernains.

The only oxygen in the hole is that allowed by creation of the space, so creatures requiring the gas cannot remain inside for more than a turn or so without opening the space again by means of the magical cloth. The cloth does not accumulate weight even if its hole is filled (with gold, for example). Each ''portable hole'' opens on its own particular non-dimensional space. If a ''bag of holding'' is placed within a ''portable hole'', a rift to the Astral plane is torn in the space, and the bag and the cloth are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a ''portable hole'' is placed within a ''bag of holding'', it opens a gate to another plane, and the hole, bag, and any creatures within a 10’ radius are drawn to the plane, the ''portable hole'' and ''bag of holding'' being destroyed in the process.

'''Pouch of Accessibility:''' This normalseeming pouch is actually a strongly magicked item which can contain up to 300 lbs, in 30 specially constructed pockets within it. Each pocket, in turn, holdsa maximum of 10 Lbs., or one cubic foot of volume, whichever is reached first.

This device also enables the possessor to open it and call forth the item(s) desired. Merely speaking the name of a desired object causes it to appear at the top of the pouch, ready for instant grasp.

These items are similar to ''bags of holding'' and ''portable holes'', and the strictures about placement within such magical spaces apply fully. The pouch weighs 1 lb, empty and 4 lbs, when filled.

'''Quaal’s Feather Token:''' ''Feather tokens'' are small magical devices of various forms to suit special needs. The types of tokens are listed below. Other token-types can be created as desired. Each token is usable once. To determine the type of ''feather token'' discovered, consult the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D20 Roll

|}
''Anchor:'' a token useful to moor a craft in water so as to render it immobile for up to one full day.

''Bird:'' a token that can be used to drive off hostile avian creatures or as a vehicle of transportation equal to a roc of the largest size (oneday duration).

''Fan:'' a token that forms a huge flapping fan which can cause a strong breeze in an area large enough to propel one ship, This wind is not cumulative with existing wind speeds—if
there is already a strong breeze blowing, this cannot be added to it to create a gale. It can, however, be used against it to create an area of relative calm or lesser winds (though this will not affect wave size in a storm, of course). The fan can be used up to eight hours a day. It will not function on land.

''Swan boat:'' a token that forms a huge swanlike boat capable of swimming at a rate of 24, and carrying eight horses and gear or 32 men or any equivalent combination (one-day duration).

''Tree:'' a token that causes a great oak to spring into being (6’ diameter trunk, 60’
height, 40’ top diameter).

''Whip:'' a token that causes a huge leather whip to appear and be wielded against any opponent desired (+1 weapon, 9th-level fighter’s attack roll, 1d6+1 points damage plus a saving throw vs. spell or be bound fast for 1d6 +1 rounds) for up to six turns. (See ''Sword of dancing'', p. 185).

'''Quiver of Ehlonna:''' This appears to be a typical arrow container capable of holding about 20 arrows. It has an aura of alteration if magic is detected for, and examination shows that it has three distinct portions. The first and smallest one can contain up to 60 objects of the same general size and shape as long bow arrows. The second, slightly longer, compartment will hold up to 18 objects of the same general size and shape as a javelin. The third and longest portion of the case will contain as many as six objects of the same general size and shape as a bow —spears or staves, for example. Such a quiver is always found empty, but once the owner has filled it, he can command the quiver to produce any stored items he wishes each round.

'''Robe of the Archmagi:''' This normalappearing garment can be white (45% —good
alignment), gray (30% —neutral, but neither good nor evil, alignment), or black (25% —evil
alignment). Its wearer gains the following powers:
# It serves as armor equal to AC 5.
# The robe confers a 5% magic resistance.
# It adds a +1 bonus to saving throw scores.
# The robe reduces the victim’s magic resistance and saving throws by 20%/-4 when the wearer casts any of the following spells: ''charm monster'', ''charm person'', ''friends'', ''hold monster'', ''hold person'', ''polymorph other'', ''suggestion''.

The color of a ''robe of the archmagi'' is not determined until it is donned by a wizard. If a white robe is donned by an evil wizard, he suffers 11d4+7 points of damage and loses 18,000-51,000 experience points at the DM’s discretion. The reverse is true with respect to a black robe donned by a good aligned wizard. An evil or good wizard putting on a gray robe, or a neutral wizard donning either a white or black robe, incurs 6d4 points damage, 6,000- 24,000 experience points loss, and the wearer will be moved toward the alignment of the robe by its enchantments (i.e., he will feel himself urged to change alignment to that of the robe, and he will have to make an effort to maintain his old alignment).

'''Robe of Blending:''' This ordinary appearing robe cannot be detected by magical means. When it is put on, however, the wearer will know that the garment has very special properties. A ''robe of blending'' enables its wearer to appear to be part of a rock wall or a plant—
whatever is appropriate, It can even make the wearer appear to be a creature of his choice.

The robe does have its limits: It will not make its wearer appear to be more than twice normal height or less than one-half normal. It does not impart vocal capabilities—either
understanding or imitating the creature the wearer looks like, (In situations where several different forms are appropriate, the wearer isMiscellaneous Magic (Robes)
obliged to state which form he wishes the robe to camouflage him as.)

Creatures with exceptional (15+) or better Intelligence have a 1% per Intelligence point chance of detecting something amiss when they are within 30° of someone disguising himself with a ''robe of blending''. Creatures with low Intelligence or better and 10 or more levels of experience or Hit Dice have a 1% chance per level or Hit Die of likewise noting something unusual about a robe-wearing character. (The latter is cumulative with the former chance for detection, so an 18 Intelligence wizard of 12th level has a 30% chance—18% + 12% —of noting something amiss.) After an initial check per eligible creature, successive checks should be made each turn thereafter, if the same creatures are within the 30’ range. All creatures acquainted with and friendly to the wearer will see him normally.

'''Robe of Eyes:''' This valuable garment appears to be a normal robe until it is put on, its wearer is able to “see” in all directions at the same moment due to scores of magical “eyes”
which adorn the robe. The wearer also gains infravision to 120’ range, and the power to see displaced or out of phase objects and creatures in their actual positions. The ''robe of eyes'' sees all forms of invisible things within a 240’ normal vision range (or 120’ if ''infravision'' is being used).

''Invisibility'', ''dust of disappearance'', ''robes of blending'', and ''improved invisibility'' are not proof against observation, but astral or ethereal things cannot be seen by means ofthis robe. Solid objects obstruct even the robe’s powers of observation. Illusions and secret doors also
can’t be seen, but creatures camouflaged or hidden in shadows are easily detected, so ambush or surprise of a character wearing a ''robe of eyes'' is impossible.

Finally, the robe enables its wearer to track as if he were a 12th-level ranger. A ''light'' spell thrown directly on a ''robe of eyes'' will blind it for 1d3 rounds, a ''continual light'' for 2d4 rounds.

'''Robe of Powerlessness:''' A ''robe of powerlessness'' appears to be a robe of another sort, and detection will discover nothing more than the fact that it has a magical aura. As soon as a character dons this garment, he drops to 3 Strength and 3 Intelligence, forgetting all spells and magical knowledge. The robe can be removed easily, but in order to restore mind and body, the character must have a ''remove curse'' spell and then a heal spell placed upon him.

'''Robe of Scintillating Colors:''' This garment appears quite normal, but a magical aura is detectable. Only a wearer with an Intelligence of 15 or higher and a Wisdom of 13 or more can cause a ''robe of scintillating colors'' to function. If Intelligence and Wisdom are sufficient, the wearer can cause the garment to become a shifting pattern of incredible hues, color after color cascading from the upper part of the robe soe ee in sparkling rainbows of dazzling ight.

This effect sheds light in a 40’ diameter sphere, and it has the power to hypnotize opponents, making them unable to attack the wearer. A full round passes before the colors begin “flowing” on the robe. Each round after that, any opponent who fails a saving throw vs. spell (or magic resistance check, then save) will stand hypnotized and transfixed for 1d4+1 rounds. Even when this effect wears off, additional saves must be made in order to attack.

Furthermore, every round of continuous scintillation of the robe makes the wearer 5%
more difficult to hit with missile attacks or hand-held or body weaponry (hands, fists, claws, fangs, horns, etc.) unti] a maximum of 25% (—5) is attained—five continuous rounds of the dazzling play of hues.

After the initial round of concealment, the wearer is able to cast spells or engage in all forms of activity that do not require movement of more than 10’ from his starting position. In non-combat situations, the robe simply hypnotizes creatures failing their saving throws vs. spell for 1d4 +1 turns.

'''Robe of Stars:''' This rather ordinaryappearing garment seems typical of apparel worn by a wizard. However, it will radiate a strong aura of alteration and evocation if examined for magic. The robe enables its wearer to travel physically on the Astral plane, along with all that he is wearing or carrying. The garment also enables the wearer to survive comfortably in the void of outer space. In other situations, the robe gives its wearer a +1 bonus to all saving throws.

The robe is embroidered with stars, and the wearer can use up to six of these as missile weapons, provided he is proficient with darts as a weapon. Each star isa throwing weapon of +5 value, both to hit and damage. Maximum range is 60° and base damage is 2d4 points per hit. The special star weapons are located on the chest portion of the robe. If the wearer does not use all of these missiles, they will replace themselves magically at the rate of one per day. If all six are used, all of the robe’s traveling and missile powers are gone forever.

'''Robe of Useful Items:''' This appears to be an unremarkable item of apparel, but a wizard who dons it will note that it is adorned with smal! cloth patches of various shapes. Only the wearer of the robe can see, recognize, and detach these patches. One patch can be detached each round. Detaching a patch causes it to become an actual item, as indicated below. A ''robe of useful items'' always begins with two each of the following patches:
* dagger
* lantern (filled and lit)
* mirror (large)
* pole (10’)
* rope (50° coil)
* sack (large)
In addition, the robe will have 4d4 items which must be diced for. Roll 4d4 to determine how many additional items a robe has and then percentile dice to determine specific items:

Multiple iterns of the same kind are permissible. Once removed, items are never replaced.

'''Robe of Vermin:''' This magical-seeming garment will radiate a dim aura of enchantment if magic is detected for. The wearer will notice nothing unusual when the robe is donned, and it will actually convey some magic power at that time—''protection +1'', for example. However, as soon as the wearer is in a situation requiring concentration and action against hostile opponents, the true nature of the garment will be revealed: The wearer immediately suffers a multitude of bites from the insects that magically infest the garment. He must cease all other activities in order to scratch, shift the robe, and generally show signs of extreme discomfort from the movement and biting of these pests.

The wearer is unable to gain initiative, and has a 50% chance of being unable to complete a spell due to the vermin. All other actions and attack forms requiring manual/locomotive/ somatic activity are at half normal probability. The garment can’t be removed except by means of a ''remove curse'' spell or similar magic.

'''Rope of Climbing:''' A 60’ long ''rope of climbing'' is no thicker than a slender wand and weighs no more than three pounds, but it is strong enough to support 3,000 pounds. Upon command, the rope will snake forward, upward, downward, or any other direction at
10’ per round and attach itself securely wherever desired. It will return or unfasten itself ina similar manner. A ''rope of climbing'' can also be commanded to knot itself. This causes large knots to appear at 1’ intervals along the rope. Knotting shortens the rope to 50’ length until the knots are untied. One end of the rope must be held by a character when its magic is invoked.

'''Rope of Constriction:''' This rope looks exactly like a ''rope of climbing'' or ''entanglement''. As soon as it is commanded to perform some action, however, it lashes itself about the neck of the character holding it, and from 1d4 others within 10’. Everyone caught by the rope is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell, Anyone failing the saving throw is strangled and crushed (2d6 hit points of damage), and theMiscellaneous Magic (Ropes)
rope continues to constrict until a dispel magic is cast upon it.

Creatures entwined by the rope cannot cast spells or free themselves. An unentangled character can cast a ''dispel magic'' or try to cut through the rope—it is AC —2 and takes 22 points of damage to cut through; all hit points must be inflicted by the same creature (not the one entangled),

'''Rope of Entanglement:''' A ''rope of entanglement'' looks just like any other magical rope. Upon command, the rope lashes forward 20’
or upward 10’ to entangle up to eight mansized creatures, For purposes of entanglement, creatures of different sizes are assigned values, as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
	! Size
	! Value
	|-
	| Tiny
	| .33*
	|-
	| Small
	| .5*
	|-
	| Medium
	| 1
	|-
	| Large
	| 3
	|-
	| Huge
	| 4
	|-
	| Gigantic
	| 8
|}
&#42; Round up

Add the values of all creatures entangled to determine how many are affected by the rope. For example, the rope could entangle up to 24 Tiny creatures or 2 Huge creatures. Any combination of sizes is possible as long as the total value doesn’t exceed eight.

The rope cannot be broken by sheer
strength—it must be hit by an edged weapon, The rope is AC —2 and takes 22 points of damage to cut through; all damage must be inflicted by the same creature (not the one entangled). Damage under 22 points will repair itself in six turns. If a ''rope of entanglement'' is severed, it is destroyed.

'''Rug of Smothering:''' This finely woven carpet resembles a ''carpet of flying'' and will detect as magical. The character seating himself upon it and giving a command will be surprised, however, as the ''rug of smothering'' rolls itself tightly around him, suffocating him in 1d4 +2 rounds. The rug cannot be physically prevented from wrapping itself, and it can be prevented from smothering its victim only by the casting of any one of the following spells: ''animate object'', ''hold plant'', ''wish''.

'''Rug of Welcome:''' A rug of this type appears exactly the same as a ''carpet of flying'', and it performs the functions of one (6’ x 9 size), but a ''rug of welcome'' has other, additional powers. Upon command it will function as a ''rug of smothering'', entrapping any creature up to ogre-size which steps upon it. A ''rug of welcome'' can also elongate itself and become as hard and strong as steel, the maximum length being 27’ x 2’. In this form, it can serve as a bridge, barricade, etc. In this latter form it is AC 0 and will take 100 points of damage to destroy, Finally, the possessor need only utter a word of command, and the rug will shrink to half size for easy storage and transportation.

'''Saw of Mighty Cutting:''' This notched adamantite blade is 12’ long and over 1’ wide. It requires 18/00 or greater Strength to operate alone, or two people of 17 or greater Strength working in tandem. The blade will slice through a 1’ diameter tree in three rounds, a 2’ thick hardwood tree in one turn, or a 4’ thick trunk in three turns. After six turns (cumulative) of cutting with the saw, the character or characters must rest for six turns before doing any further work.

'''Scarab of Death:''' This small pin appears to be any one of the various beneficial amulets, brooches, or scarabs. However, if it is held for more than one round or placed within a soft container (bag, pack, etc.) within 1’ of a warm, living body for one turn, it changes into a horrible burrowing beetle-like creature. The thing will tear through any leather or cloth, burrow into flesh, and reach the victim’s heart in a single round, causing death. It then returns to its scarab form. (Placing the scarab in a container of hard wood, ceramic, bone. ivory, or metal will prevent the monster from coming to life.)

'''Scarab of Enraging Enemies:''' When one of these devices is displayed and a command uttered, all intelligent hostile creatures within a
40° radius must successfully save vs. spell or become enraged. Those whose saving throws succeed may perform normally; enraged enemies fly into a berserk fury and attack the nearest creature, even their own comrades (+1 bonus to attack rolls, +2 bonus to damage,
~3 to their own Armor Class).

The rage lasts for 1d6é +6 rounds, and during this period, the enraged creatures will attack continually, without reason or fear, moving on to attack other creatures nearest them if initial opponents are slain. A scarab of this type contains from 1d6 +18 charges.

'''Scarab of Insanity:''' This item is indistinguishable from any other amulet, brooch, or scarab. When displayed and a command word is spoken, all other creatures within a 20’ radius must save vs. spell with a —2 penalty (and
-10% penalty to any magic resistance as well). Those failing the save are completely insane for 1d4 +8 rounds, unable to cast spells or use reasoning of any sort (treat as a ''confusion spell'' with no chance for acting in a nonconfused manner). The scarab has 1d8+8 charges.

'''Scarab of Protection:''' This device appears to be any one of the various magical amulets, stones, etc, It gives off a faint magical aura, however, and if it is held for one round, an inscription will appear on its surface letting the holder know it is a protective device.

The possessor gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws vs. spell. If no save is normally possible, he gets a one in 20 chance of saving, adjusted by any other magical protections that normally give bonuses to saving throws. Thus, this device allows a saving throw vs. spell at base 20 against ''magic missile'' attacks, for example. If the target also has a +4 bonus for magical armor and a +1 bonus for a ''ring of protection'', any roll of 15 or better would indicate that the missiles did no damage.

The searab can also absorb up to 12 leveldraining attacks (two level drains count as two absorbings), ''death touches'', ''death rays'', or ''fingers of death''. However, upon absorbing 12 such attacks the scarab turns to powder—
totally destroyed.

One in 20 of these scarabs will be a cursed item, giving the possessor a —2 penalty to his saving throws. However, one in five of these cursed items will become a +2 scarab if the curse is removed by a cleric of 16th-level or higher. In this case, the scarab wil) have absorption capability of 24 rather than 12.

'''Scarab Versus Golems:''' This magical pin enables its wearer to detect any golem within 60’, although he must concentrate in order for the detection to take place. Furthermore, the scarab enables its possessor to combat a golem, with hand-held or missile weapons, as if it were a normal monster, with no special defenses. Each scarab has this effect with regard to a different sort of golem. Roll percentile dice and consult the table below:

'''Sheet of Smallness:''' A magical item of this sort appears to be nothing more than a wellmade piece of material—possibly some sort of covering or sheet woven of very fine linen or silk. One side will have a larger pattern than the other, or perhaps one side will be white, the other black. In any event, there will be an aura of alteration detectable from this cloth if magic is checked for.

This item causes any magical item wrapped within it to shrink to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub> its normal size and weight. If the item is then wrapped in the sheet so as to be touching the reverse side of the material, it will grow back to its normal size and weight, Note that this item has no effect on artifacts, relics, or living material—it affects only non-living, ordinary magical items—and
no item shrunk in this fashion is functional or usable while in reduced form. Change in size requires two rounds to accomplish, either in shrinking or restoring to normal size.

'''Slippers of Spider Climbing:''' These shoes appears unremarkable, although they will give off a faint aura of alteration magic if detected for. When worn, a pair of these slippers enable the individual to move at a 60’ rate on vertical surfaces or even upside down along ceilings, with hands free to do whatever the wearer desires, Extremely slippery surfaces—ice, oiled, or greased surfaces—make these slippers useless.

'''Smoke Powder:''' This magical substance is similar, though not identical, to gunpowder. It is extremely scarce and, due to its volatile nature, dangerous to fabricate. ''Smoke powder'' will be available in a campaign only if the DM allows it, If the DM doesn’t want it in the campaign, it simply doesn’t exist.

''Smoke powder'' is commonly found divided into two separate components—one, a steelyblue granular substance, the other, a fine white powder. Alone, each component is inert and harmless. However, when equal portions of the two are mixed together, the ''smoke powder'' is complete and dangerous.

When touched by a flame, the mixed powder explodes with great force, noise, and smoke, The size and force of the explosion varies according to the amount of ''smoke powder'' used. A small, measured amount (a spoonful of each component) causes 1d2 points of damage. Such an amount is sufficient for a large firecracker or a single charge of an arquebus (if these optional weapons exist in the campaign), Increasing the amount increases the damage proportionally—
doubling causes 2d2 points of damage, tripling causes 3d2. and so on.

An explosion capable of causing 30 points of damage (15 charges) has a 5‘ radius. Blasts capable of causing 50 or more points of damage (25 or more charges) have a radius of 15 feet, and affect items and fortifications as would a
giant’s blow.

When discovered, a pouch of smoke powder contains 3d6 charges. Charges from several pouches of ''smoke powder'' can be combined to create bigger, more damaging, explosions.

'''Sovereign Glue:''' This pale amber substance is thick and viscous. Because of its particular powers, it can be contained only within a flask coated with ''oil of slipperiness'', and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the flask, a new application of the ''oil of slipperiness'' must be put on the flask within one round to prevent the remaining glue from adhering to the side of the container.

One ounce of the adhesive will cover approximately one square foot of surface, bonding virtually any two substances together in a permanent union. The glue takes one full round to set; if the objects are pulled apart before that time has elapsed, that application of the glue will lose its stickiness and be worthless. If the glue is allowed to set, then attempting to separate the two bonded objects will only result in the rending of one or the other except when ''oil of etherealness'' or ''universal solvent'' is applied to the bond—''sovereign glue'' is dissolved only by those liquids. A typical container of the substance holds 1d10 ounces of glue.

'''Spade of Colossal Excavation:''' This digging tool is 8’ long with a spade-like blade 2’ wide and 3’ long. Any fighter with 18 Strength can use this magical shovel to dig great holes. One cubic yard of normal earth can be excavated in one round. After 10 rounds of digging, the user must rest for five rounds. Hard pan clay takes twice as long to dig, as does gravel. Loose soil takes only half as long.

'''Sphere of Annihilation:''' A ''sphere of annihilation'' is a globe of absolute blackness, a ball of nothingness 2° in diameter. A sphere is actually a hole in the continuity of the multiverse, a void. Any matter that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void, gone, utterly destroyed—even wishes and similar magicks have no effect!

A ''sphere of annihilation'' is basically static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort. The brain waves of the individual concentrating on moving it bend spatial fabrics, causing the hole to slide, Control range is 40°
initially, 10’/level once control is established. Basic movement rate is 10’ per round, modified as shown below.

Concentration control is based on Intelligence and level of experience—the higher the level the greater the mental power and discipline. For every point of Intelligence above 12, the wizard adds 1%; for every point over 15, he adds another 3%. In other words, add 1%
for each point from 13 to 15, and an additional 3% for each point from 16-18—a maximum of 12% bonus at 18 Intelligence. The bonus applies to this table:
{| class="wikitable"
	! Level of Wizard
	! Movement/Round
	! Probability of Control/Round
	|-
	| up to 5th
	| 8’
	| 15%
	|-
	| 6th-7th
	| 9’
	| 20%

	| 8th-9th
	| 10’
	| 30%
	|-
	| 10th-11th
	| 11’
	| 40%
	|-
	| 12th-13th

	| 14th-15th
	| 13’
	| 60%
	|-
	| 16th-17th
	| 14’
	| 70%
	|-
	| 18th-20th
	| 15’
	| 75%
	|-
	| 21st & above
	| 16’
	| 80%
|}
Any attempt to control the sphere will cause it to move, but if control is not established, the sphere will slide toward the wizard attempting to move it, The sphere will continue to move in this direction for 1d4 rounds and as long as the wizard is within 30° thereafter.

If two or more wizards vie for control of a ''sphere of annihilation'', the one with the highest percentage chance to control the sphere is checked first, then the next strongest, etc. Control chance is reduced 5% per person, cumulative, when two or more wizards concentrate on the sphere, even if they are cooperating. If none are successful, the sphere will slip toward the strongest. Control must be checked each round.

Should a gate spell be cast upon a sphere, there is a 50% chance that the spell will destroy it, 35% that the spell will do nothing, and 15% that a gap will be torn in the spatial fabric, and everything in a 180’ radius will be catapulted into another plane or universe.

If a ''rod of cancellation'' touches a sphere, a tremendous explosion will occur as they negate each other. Everything within a 60 radius °
will sustain 3d4 x 10 points of damage. See also ''talisman of the sphere''. below.

'''Stone Horse:''' Each item of this nature appears to be full-sized, roughly hewn statue of a horse, carved from some type of hard stone. A command word brings the steed to life, enabling it to carry a burden, and even to attack as if it were a warhorse. There are two sorts of steeds:

''Courser:'' This ''stone horse'' travels at the same movement rate as a light horse (movement rate 24) and attacks as if it were a medium warhorse (three attacks for 1d6/1d6/1d3). It is Armor Class 3 and has 18 hit points. It saves versus all applicable attack forms as if it were “Metal, hard.”

''Destrier:'' This ''stone horse'' travels at the same movement rate as a medium horse (movement rate 18) and attacks as if it were a heavy warhorse (three attacks for 1d8/1d8/ 1d3). It is Armor Class 1 and has 26 hit points. It saves versus all applicable attack forms as if it were “Metal, hard.”

A ''stone horse'' can carry 1,000 pounds tirelessly and never needs to rest or feed, Damage inflicted upon it can be repaired by first using a ''stone to flesh'' spell, thus causing the stone horse to become a normal horse. If then allowed to graze and rest, the animal will heal its wounds at the rate of one point per day. When it is fully healed, it will automatically revert to its magical form.

'''Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals:''' A stone of this nature is typically an oddly shaped bit of roughly polished rock. The possessor of such a stone need but utter a single command word, and an earth elemental of 12- Hit-Dice size will come to the summoner if earth is available, an 8-Hit-Dice elemental if rough, unhewn stone is the summoning medium. (An earth elemental cannot be summoned from worked stone, but one can be from mud, clay, or even sand, although one from sand is an eight-dice monster.) The area of summoning for an earth elemental must be at least 4’ square and have four cubic yards volume. The elemental will appear in 1d4 rounds. For detailed information about elementals and their control see the ''Monstrous Compendium''. The stone can be used to summon one elemental per day.

'''Stone of Good Luck (Luckstone):''' This magical stone is typically a bit of rough polished agate or similar mineral. Its possessor gains a +1 (+5% where applicable) on all dice rolls involving factors such as saving, slipping, dodging, etc.—whenever dice are rolled to find whether the character suffers from some adverse happening. This luck does not affect attack and damage rolls or spell failure dice.

Additionally, the ''luckstone'' gives the possessor a +/-1% to 10% (at owner’s option) on rolls for determination of magical items or division of treasure. The most favorable results will always be gained with a ''stone of good luck''.

'''Stone of Weight (Loadstone):''' This magical stone appears to be any one of the other sorts, and testing will not reveal its nature. However, as soon as the possessor of a ''stone of weight'' is in a situation where he is required to move quickly in order to avoid an enemy—combat or
pursuit—the item causes a 50% reduction in movement, and even attacks are reduced to 50% normal rate, Furthermore, the stone cannot be gotten rid of by any nonmazgical
means—if it is thrown away or smashed, it will reappear somewhere on the character’s person.Armor and Shields If a ''dispel evil'' is cast upon a ''loadstone'', the item will disappear and no longer haunt the individual.

'''Talisman of Pure Good:''' A high priest who possesses this item can cause an flaming crack to open at the feet of an evil priest. The intended victim will be swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman must be good, and if he is not exceptionally pure in thought and deed, the evil priest will gain a saving throw vs. death.

A ''talisman of pure good'' has seven charges. It cannot be recharged. If a neutral priest touches one of these magic stones, he will suffer 7d4 points of damage. If an evil priest touches one, he will suffer 12d4 points of damage. Non-priests will not be affected by the device.

'''Talisman of the Sphere:''' This isa small adamantite loop and handle which will be useless to non-wizards. Characters of any other class touching a talisman of this sort will suffer 5d6 points of damage. When held by a wizard concentrating on control of a ''sphere of annihilation'', a ''talisman of the sphere'' doubles the Intelligence bonus percentage for control (i.e., 2% per point of Intelligence from 13-15, 6%
per point of Intelligence from 16-18).

If control is established by the wielder of a talisman, he need check for continual control only every other round thereafter. If control is not established, the sphere will move toward the wizard at maximum speed (16’/round). Note that a wand of negation will have no effect upon a ''sphere of annihilation'', but if the wand is directed at the talisman it will negate its power of control as long as the wand is directed at it.

'''Talisman of Ultimate Evil:''' This device exactly resembles a ''talisman of pure good'' and is exactly its opposite in all respects. It has six c ‘

'''Talisman of Zagy:''' A talisman of this sort appears exactly the same as a ''stone controlling earth elementals''. Its powers are quite different, however, and are dependent upon the Charisma of the individual holding the talisman. Whenever a character touches a ''talisman of Zagy'', a reaction check is made as if the individual were meeting another creature.

If a hostile reaction result is obtained, the device will act as a ''stone of weight'', although discarding it or destroying it results only in 5d6 points of damage and the disappearance of the talisman.

If a neutral reaction results, the talisman will remain with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a ''wish'' is made upon it, whichever first occurs, and it will then disappear.

If a friendly reaction result is obtained, the character will find it impossible to be rid of the talisman for as many months as he has points of Charisma.

The device will grant one ''wish'' for every six points of the character’s Charisma. It will also grow warm and throb whenever its possessor comes within 20’ of a mechanical or magical trap. (lf the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses will be of no avail.)

Regardless of which reaction result is obtained, when its time period expires, the talisman will disappear. A base 10,000 gp diamond will remain in its stead.

'''Tome of Clear Thought:''' A work of this nature is indistinguishable from any normal book. Any single character who reads a ''tome of clear thought'' will be able to practice mental exercises that will increase his Intelligence by one point. Reading a work of this nature takes 48 hours time over six days, and immediately thereafter the book disappears.

The reader must begin a program of concentration and mental disciplines within one week of reading the tome. After a month of such exercise, Intelligence goes up. The knowledge gained from reading the work can never be recorded or articulated. Any further perusal of a ''tome of clear thought'' will be of no benefit to the character.

'''Tome of Leadership and Influence:''' This leather-and-brass-bound book is similar to a ''tome of clear thought'', but upon completion of reading and practice of what was revealed therein, Charisma is increased by one point.

'''Tome of Understanding:''' Identical to a ''tome of clear thought''. this work increases Wisdom by one point.

'''Universal Solvent:''' This strange and magical liquid appears to be some sort of minor oil or potion. Upon first examination, it seems to have the properties of both ''oil of slipperiness'' and a ''potion of delusion''. However, if it is applied to any form of adhesive or sticky material, the solution will immediately dissolve it. Thus, for instance, the effect of ''sovereign glue'' will immediately be negated by this liquid, as will any other form of cement, glue, or adhesive. The area of effect of this liquid is one cubic foot per ounce, and a typical container holds 27 ounces.

If the liquid is carefully distilled to bring it down to one-third of its original volume, each ounce will dissolve one cubic foot of organic or inorganic material, just as if a ''disintegrate'' spell had been employed. To find if a target is affected by this concentrated solution, a normal attack roll is required, and the subject is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. Inanimate objects are automatially affected by the solution, although if they are magical, a saving throw vs. disintegrate applies.

'''Vacuous Grimoire:''' A book of this sort is identical to a normal one, although if a ''detect magic'' spell is cast, a magical aura will be noted. Any character who opens the work and reads so much as a single glyph therein must make two saving throws vs. spell. The first is to determine if one point of Intelligence is lost or not; the second is to find if two points of Wisdom are lost. Once opened and read, the ''vacuous grimoire'' remains; to be destroyed, the book must be burned and a ''remove curse'' spell cast. If the tome is placed with other books, its appearance will instantly alter to conform to the look of these other works.

'''Well of Many Worlds:''' This strange interdimensional device looks just like a ''portable hole''. Anything placed within it is immediately cast to another world—a parallel earth, another planet, or a different plane at the DM’s option or by random determination. If the well is moved, the random factor again comes into play. It can be picked up, folded, etc., just like a ''portable hole'', Things from the world the well touches can come through the opening, just as easily as from the initiating place.

'''Wind Fan:''' A ''wind fan'' appears to be nothing more than a wood and papyrus or cloth instrument with which to create a cooling breeze. The possessor can, however, by uttering the correct word, cause the fan to generate air movement duplicating a ''gust of wind'' spell as if cast by a Sth-level wizard. The fan can be used once per day with no risk. If it is used more frequently, there is a cumulative 20%
chance per usage that the device will tear into useless, nonmagical tatters.

'''Wings of Flying:''' A pair of these magical wings appears to be nothing more than a plain cloak of old, black cloth. If the wearer speaks a command word, the cloak will turn into a pair of gigantic bat wings (20° span) and empower the wearer to fly as follows:
* 2 turns at speed 32
* 3 turns at speed 25
* 4 turns at speed 18
* 6 turns at speed 15
* 6 turns at speed 12 After the maximum number of possible turns flying, the wearer must rest for one
hour—sitting, lying down, or sleeping, Shorter periods of flight do not require full rest, but only relative quiet such as slow walking for one hour, Any flight of less than one turn’s
duration does not require any rest. ''Wings of flying'' can be used just once per day regardless of the length of time spent flying. They will support up to 500 pounds weight.

== Armor and Shields ==
In this section, you will find descriptions of some very special kinds of armor and shields. Before adding these to your campaign, however, be sure you are fully familiar with the armor gradation system:

For each +1 bonus to armor, regardless of the type of armor, the wearer’s Armor Class moves downward (toward AC 2...to 1...to 0, -1, -1 -2, and so on). A normal shield improves the armor class by one. A magical shield improves Armor Class like magical armor—toward -1, -2, etc. Note, however, that Armor Class can never be improved beyond -10.

Thus, ''chain mail +1'' is like ordinary chain mail (AC 5), but one category better (AC 4). A ''shield + 1'' is equal to Armor Class 8—two places better than no armor (+1 for bearing a shield, +1 for the magical bonus of the shield).

When adding magical armor to the game, be aware of sizing problems: 65% of all armorMagical Weapons (except ''elven chain mail'') is man-sized, 20% is elf-sized, 10% is dwart-sized, and but 5% gnome- or halfling-sized. (''Elven chain mail'' sizing is determined by the table found below.)

Special armor and shields are described below:

'''Armor of Blending:''' This appears to be a normal suit of magical armor (determine type and AC modifier normally, ignoring negative results), However, upon command (a command word can be assigned if the DM desires), the armor changes shape and form, assuming, the appearance of a normal set of clothing. The armor retains all its properties (including weight) when disguised. Only a ''true seeing'' spell will reveal the true nature of the armor when disguised.

'''Armor of Command:''' This finely crafted plate mail radiates a powerful aura of magic. When worn, the armor bestows a dignified and commanding aura upon its owner. The wearer is treated as if he had a Charisma of 18 tor all encounter reactions, Friendly troops within 360 feet of the user have their morale increased by +2. Otherwise, the armor ''functions as plate mail +1''. Since the effect arises in great part from the distinctiveness of the armor, the wearer cannot hide or conceal himself in any way and still have the effect function.

'''Armor of Missile Attraction:''' This armor appears to be a normal suit of magical armor (determine type and modifier normally). However, the armor is cursed and actually serves to attract missiles. The wearer is two or three times more likely to be selected as a random target of missiles than normal. In cases where each person is the target of a set number of missiles (most often in large combats), the wearer will have a greater number of missiles fired at him, Furthermore, the magical protection of the armor will fail when calculated for missile attacks. The true nature of the armor will not reveal itself until the character is fired upon in earnest —simple experiments (throwing rocks, etc.) will not suffice.

'''Armor of Rage:''' This armor is identical in appearance to ''armor of command'' and functions as a suit of ''plate mail +1''. However, when worn, the armor causes the character to suffer a -3 penalty to all encounter checks. All triendly troops within 360 feet have their morale lowered by -2. The effect is not noticeable to the wearer or those affected (i.e., characters will not immediately notice that donning the armor is the cause of their problems).

'''Elven Chain Mail:''' This is magical armor so tine and light that it can be worn under normal clothing without revealing its presence, Its lightness and flexibility allow even bards and thieves to use it with few restrictions (see page 39 in the ''PHB''). Elven fighter/mages use it without restriction. However, it is rarely sized to fit anyone other than an elf or a half-elf. Roll percentile dice and consult the following table to ascertain what size character ''elven chain mail'' will fit:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D100 Roll
	! Size of Elven Chain Mail
	|-
	| 01-10
	| gnome/halfling (hairfoot)
	|-
	| 11-15
	| dwarf /halfling (Stout or Tallfellow)
	|-
	| 16-80
	| elf /half-elf*
	|-
	| 81-95
	| man-sized, normal (up to 6’, 200 Lbs.)
	|-
	| 96-00
	| man-sized , large (up to 6’/2’, 250 Lbs.)
|}

'''Plate Mail of Etherealness:''' This is seemingly normal ''plate mail +5'', but if a command word is spoken, the suit enables its wearer and all nonliving items he wears and carries to become ethereal, as if ''oil of etherealness'' had been used, While in the ethereal state the wearer cannot attack material creatures. A phase door spell will negate the ethereal state and prevent the armor from functioning for one day.

There are 20 charges placed upon ''plate mail of etherealness''. Once used, these cannot be replaced or recharged. Furthermore, every five uses reduces the bonus of the armor by one: If tive charges are used to become ethereal, the armor is +4, if 10 are used it is +3, +2 if 15 are used, and only +1 if all 20 are exhausted.

'''Plate Mail of Fear:''' This armor functions as normal ''plate mal +1''. However, it is imbued with 2d2 ''fear'' charges. Upon uttering the command, a charge is spent and the wearer radiatesa 30-foot aura of fear. All creatures (except the one wearing the armor) must save vs. spell or flee in panic for 1d4+1 rounds. When all charges are spent, the armor functions as normal ''plate mail +1''. It cannot be recharged.

'''Plate Mail of Vulnerability:''' This appears to every test to be magical plate ''mail +1, +2, or +3'', but it is actually cursed ''plate mail -2, -3, or -4''. The armor’s great vulnerability will not be apparent until an enemy successfully strikes a blow in anger with desire and intent to kill the wearer. The armor will fall to pieces whenever an opponent strikes the wearer with an unmodified atack roll of 20.

'''Shield, large, +1, +4 versus missiles:''' This is a large shield with a +1 bonus vs. melee attacks, but it is four times more effective against hand-hurled and mechanically propelled missiles of all sorts. More importantly, the shield has a 20% chance of negating ''magic missile'' attacks (from a frontal position).

'''Shield -1, missile attractor:''' This not only makes the bearer equivalent to a shieldless person, it also attracts missiles of all types to itselfIt doubles or triples the bearer’s chances of being selected by random die rolling according to the size of the party he is with (see “Firing into Melee” page 62). This cursed shield is not distinguishable from a useful magical shield.

== Magical Weapons ==
Magical weapons normally apply their bonuses (+1, +2, +3, or +4) to both attack and damage rolls, Any weapon that is not totally self-explanatory is detailed in one of the special paragraphs below.

Most weapons are of the specific type listed. However, 70% of swords are long swords, 20% are scimitars or broad swords, 5% are short (small) swords, 4% are bastard swords, and 1% are two-handed swords, unless the description of a specific item indicates otherwise. Magical pole arms can be of any type desired. Magical lances are always heavy lances. Other unusual weapons may have special restrictions given in the description of the item.

Spears can be used as hand or missile weapons. As missile weapons, they can be broken by any creature with 18/00 or greater Strength or by one that is massive (e.g., cave bear, hippo, or rhino). Intelligent creatures will be 70% likely to use the hurled spear against the hurler if struck by the weapon, 25% likely to break it (the spear must save versus crushing blow). Unintelligent creatures will be 25% likely to break it (save as above).

Hand Axes (not battle-axes) can be thrown up to 30 yards and still gain any magical attack roll bonus, but no damage bonus.

=== Light Generation ===
The DM can rule that magical weapons (particularly swords, daggers, and +3 or greater items) shed light and can’t be concealed when drawn. However, a magical sword should never glow until the wielder is aware of its magical properties—the light-giving property of a weapon should never be used as an excuse to identify a magical item. Note that the ''flame tongue'', ''frost brand'', ''holy avenger'', ''life stealing'', and ''sharpness'' swords have special properties with regard to light. These are dealt with in the individual weapon descriptions.

=== Unknown or Unusual Qualities ===
'''Intelligent Weapons:''' One of the rarer and more significant properties of a magical weapon is the chance that it is intelligent. The feature is most common among swords, but there are occasional instances of other weapons possessing intelligence, The chance of intelligence varies according to the type of weapon.

Swords have a 25% chance of some form of intelligence. Other melee weapons (axes, spears, polearms, etc.) have a 5% chance of intelligence, provided they do not already possess special powers. Missile weapons (including bows, crossbows, arrows, and bolts) never possess intelligence. Single-use items and those items that do not have a bonus to hit (such asa magical net) never possess intelligence.

If you determine that a weapon is intelligent, it will have one or more special powers, it may also have a special purpose or limitations on its use, This information is found under Intelligent Weapons (page 186).

'''Unknown Qualities:''' Whenever a weapon has some unknown quality—such as the ''wishes'' in a ''luck blade''—the DM should prepare a special 3” x 5” index card on it and keep the information handy whenever the possessor of the weapon is playing.

'''Magic arrows:''' When a magical arrow misses its target, there is a 50% chance it will break or otherwise be rendered useless. A magical arrow that hits is destroyed.

=== Magical Weapon List ===
'''Arrow of Direction:''' This typically appears to be a normal arrow. However, its magical properties make it function like a ''locate object'' spell, empowering the arrow to show the direction to the nearest stairway, passage, cave, etc.

Once per day the device can be tossed into the air; it will fall and point in the requested direction. This process can be repeated seven times during the next seven turns. The request must be for one of the following:
* Stairway (up or down)
* Sloping passage (up or down)
* Dungeon exit or entrance.
* Cave or cavern. Requests must be phrased by distance (nearest, farthest, highest, lowest) or by direction (north, south, east, west, etc.).

'''Arrow of Slaying:''' This is an ''arrow +3'' with unusual physical characteristics—a shaft of some special material, feathers of some rare creature, a head of some strange design, a rune carved on the nock, etc. These characteristics indicate the arrow is effective against some creature type. If the arrow is employed against the kind of creature it has been enchanted to slay, the missile will kill it instantly if it hits the target creature. The following list comprises only a portion of the possible kinds of these arrows:
{| class="wikitable"
	| 1. Arachnids
	| 11. Illusionists
	|-
	| 2. Avians
	| 12. Mages
	|-
	| 3. Bards
	| 13. Mammals

	|-
	| 10. Golems
	| 20. Undead
|}
Develop your own types and modify or limit the foregoing as fits your campaign.

'''Axe +2, throwing:''' This hand axe can be thrown up to 180’ with the same attack roll and damage bonuses ( +2) as if it were swung by the character.

'''Axe of Hurling:''' This appears to be a normal hand axe. With familiarity and practice, however, the possessor will eventually discover that the axe can be hurled up to 180’, and it will return to the thrower in the same round whether or not it scores a hit. Damage inflicted by the magical throwing attack is twice normal (2d6 vs. S or M, 2d4 vs. L), with the weapon’s magical bonus added thereafter. (For example, an ''axe of hurling +3'' will inflict 2d6 +3 points of damage vs. S-or M-sized creatures and 2d4 +3 points of damage vs. creatures of size L if it hits the target after being thrown.) The axe will cause only normal damage (plus its magical Magical Weapons (Descriptions) bonus) when used as a hand-held weapon.

After each week of using the weapon, the possessor has a one-in-eight chance of discovering the full properties of the weapon. In any event, the magical properties of the weapon will be fully known to the possessor after eight full weeks of such familiarization.

The magical bonus of an ''axe of hurling'' is determined by referring to the table below:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D20 Roll
	! Magical Bonus
	! XP Value
	|-
	| 1-5
	| +1
	| 1,500
	|-
	| 6-10
	| +2
	| 3,000
	|-
	| 11-15
	| +3
	| 4,500
	|-
	| 16-19
	| +4
	| 6,000
	|-
	| 20
	| +5
	| 7,500
|}

'''Bow +1:''' This gives a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls to arrows fired from it. If magical arrows are used, total the bonuses of both the bow and the arrows used. The type of bow found (composite, short, long, etc.) should be based on the circumstances of your campaign and the nature of the area. A nonmagical arrow fired from a magical bow is a nonmagical missile.

'''Crossbow of Accuracy, +3:''' This gives a +3 bonus to attack rolls with its missiles but not to damage. All ranges are considered short. About 10% of these weapons will be heavy crossbows.

'''Crossbow of Distance:''' This has double range in all categories. About 10% of these weapons will be heavy crossbows. This weapon is otherwise +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

'''Crossbow of Speed:''' This item allows its possessor to double the rate of fire normal for the weapon, If it is grasped, the ''crossbow of speed'' will automatically cock itself. In surprise situations it is of no help. Otherwise, it allows first fire in any melee round, and end-of-round fire also, when applicable. About 10% of these weapons are heavy crossbows. The weapon has a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

'''Dagger + 2, Longtooth:''' This appears to be a normal weapon, or perhaps a non-special magical weapon. However, when this broadbladed weapon is wielded by a small demihuman (e.g., gnome or halfling). it will actually lengthen and function as a short sword (retaining its +2 bonus in this form). Even when functioning in this way it remains as light and handy to use as a dagger would be in the hands of the same character. The weapon will actually penetrate wood or stone as easily as it will softer material, inflicting maximum damage against either substance.

'''Dagger of Throwing:''' This appears to be a normal weapon but will radiate strongly of magic when this is checked for. The balance of this sturdy blade is perfect, such that when it is thrown by anyone, the dagger will demonstrate superb characteristics as a ranged weapon, The magic of the dagger enables it to be hurled up to 180’. A successful hit when it is thrown will inflict twice normal dagger damage, plus the bonus provided by the blade, which will range from +1 to +4. To determine the bonus for a specific dagger, roll percentile dice and consult the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
	! D100 Roll
	! Magical Bonus
	! XP Value
	|-
	| 01-35
	| +1
	| 250
	|-
	| 36-65
	| +2
	| 350
	|-
	| 66-90
	| +3
	| 450
	|-
	| 91-00
	| +4
	| 550
|}

'''Dagger of Venom:''' This appears to be a standard ''dagger +1'', but its hilt holds a hidden store of poison. Any hit on a roll of 20 injects fatal poison into the opponent unless a saving throw vs. poison is successful. The ''dagger of venom'' holds up to six doses of poison. If the hilt cointains fewer than six doses, the owner can pour more in up to the maximum. (Use of this weapon by good—particularly lawful good—characters must be carefully monitored for effects on alignment.)

'''Darts of Homing:''' These appear to be normal projectiles, but are actually +3 magical weapons. If a dart hits the intended target, it will magically return to the thrower in the same round and can be re-used. A dart inflicts a base 1d6 points of damage plus its magical bonus on a successful hit against any size creature (4-9 points total). A dart that misses its target loses its magical power. These weapons have twice the range of ordinary darts—20 yards short, 40 yards medium, 80 yards long.

'''Hammer +3, Dwarven Thrower:''' This appears to be a standard ''hammer +2''. In the hands of a dwarven fighter who knows the appropriate command word, its full potential is realized. In addition to the +3 bonus, the hammer has the following characteristics:

The hammer has a 180’ range and will return to its wielder’s hand like a boomerang. It has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls. When hurled, the hammer inflicts double damage against all opponents except giants (including ogres, ogre magi, trolls, and ettins). Against enue causes triple damage (plus the bonus +3).

'''Hammer of Thunderbolts:''' This appears to be a large, extra-heavy hammer. A character less than 6’ tall and with Strength less than 18/ 01 will find it too unbalanced to wield properly in combat. However, a character of sufficient Strength and size will find that the hammer functions with a +3 bonus and gains double damage dice on any hit.

If the wielder wears a ''girdle of giant strength'' and ''gauntlets of ogre power'' and he knows the hammer’s true name, the weapon can be used to full effect: When swung or hurled it gains a +5 bonus, double damage dice, all girdle and gauntlet bonuses, and it strikes dead any giant upon which it scores a hit.

(Depending on the campaign, the DM might wish to limit the effect to exclude storm giants and include ogres, ogre magi, trolls, ettins, and clay, flesh, and stone golems.)

When hurled and successfully hitting, a great noise, like a clap of thunder, stuns all creatures within 90’ for one round. Throwing range is 180’. (Thor would throw the hammer about double the above range.) The ''hammer of thunderbolts'' is difficult to hurl, so only one throw every other round can be made. After five throws within the space of any two-turn period, the wielder must rest for one turn.

Hammers can be hurled as hand axes.

'''Hornblade:''' This is a magical weapon with a sickle-like blade resembling some sort of animal horn. ''Hornblades'' range in size from that of a knife to somewhat less than the length of a short sword. Even a close inspection is 90% unlikely to reveal it as anything other than a piece of horn of ½’ to 1¼’ in length, set in some sort of handle or grip. If magic is detected for, a ''hornblade'' will radiate faintly of enchantment magic. However, if the proper pressure is applied in the correct place, a curved blade of great strength and sharpness will spring out.

The small versions (knife-sized and daggersized) are usually enchanted to +1 or +2, and the largest version (scimitar-sized) commonly has a bonus of +2 or +3, Smaller ''hornblades'' can be thrown, and the bonus applies to both the attack number and damage determination.

Any character class permitted to use sicklelike weapons can use a ''hornblade''. The possessor can use it with proficiency, providing he has proficiency with the appropriately sized weapon (knife, dagger, or scimitar).

The experience-point value of a ''hornblade'' depends upon its size and the amount of its magical bonus:
{| class="wikitable"
	! Size
	! XP Value
	|-
	| Knife-sized
	| 500 per “plus”
	|-
	| Dagger-sized
	| 750 per “plus”
	|-
	| Scimitar-sized
	| 1,000 per “plus”

'''Javelin of Lightning:''' A ''javelin of lightning'' is considered equal to a +2 magical weapon, although it has neither attack nor damage bonuses. It hasa range of 90 yards and whenever it strikes, the javelin becomes the head of a 5’ wide, 30’ long stroke of lightning. Any creature hit by the javelin suffers 1d6é points of damage, plus 20 points of electrical damage. Any other creatures in the path of the stroke take either 10 or 20 points of damage, based on whether their saving throws are successful or not.

From 2-5 javelins will be found. The javelin is consumed in the lightning discharge.

'''Javelin of Piercing:''' This weapon is not actually hurled—when a command word is spoken, the ''javelin of piercing'' launches itself. Range is 180’, all distances considered as short range. The javelin has a +6 bonus to attack rolls and inflicts 1d6é+6 points of damage. (Note this missile will fly horizontally, vertically, or any combination thereof to the full extent of its range.) From 2-8(2d4) will be found at one time. The magic of the javelin of piercing is good tor only one throw after which it becomes a normal javelin.

'''Knife, Buckle:''' This magical blade has a hilt that looks just like a large belt-buckle ornament or a complete small buckle. The hilt can be grasped easily and the weapon drawn from its belt-sheath. The knife blade is short but has a very sharp point—it inflicts damage as a knife.

'''Mace of Disruption:''' This appears to be a ''mace +1'', but it has a neutral good alignment, and any evil character touching it will receive 5d4 points of damage due to the powerful enchantments laid upon the weapon. If a ''mace of disruption'' strikes any undead creature or evil creature from one of the lower planes, may utterly destroy the creature.

Skeletons, zombies, ghouls, shadows, wights, and ghasts, if hit, are instantly blasted out of existence, Other creatures roll saving throws as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
	! Creature
	! Save
	|-
	| Wraiths
	| 5%
	|-
	| Mummies
	| 20%

	|-
	| Vampires
	| 50%
	|-
	| Ghosts
	| 65%
	|-
	| Liches
	| 80%
	|-
	| Other affected evil creatures
	| 95%
|}

Even if these saving throws are effective, the ''mace of disruption'' scores double damage upon opponents of this sort, and twice the damage bonus.

'''Net of Entrapment:''' This magical rope net is strong enough to defy Strength under 20 and is equal to AC — 10 with respect to blows aimed at cutting it, (Normal sawing attempts to cut it with dagger or sword will not succeed; to sever a strand of the mesh, a character must hack at it until he does 5 points of damage on a strand.)

Each net is 10° square and has 3”-square mesh. It can be thrown 20’ so as to cover and close upon opponents: each creature in range must roll a successful saving throw vs. dragon breath to avoid being entrapped, It can be suspended from a ceiling (or generally overhead) and drop upon a command word. It can be laid upon the floor and close upward upon command. The net stretches so as to close over an area up to five cubic feet. It can be loosened by its possessor on command,

'''Net of Snaring:'''  This net looks just like a ''net of entrapment'', but it functions only underwater. There, it can be commanded to shoot forth up to 30” to trap a creature. It is otherwise the same as the net of entrapment.

'''Quarterstaff, Magical:''' This appears to be a normal bronzewood staff banded with iron. The shaft is actually as strong as steel, and has two magical qualities. Upon command, the staff will alter its length from as short as 6’ to as long as 12’ (or any length in between). It inflicts damage as a quarterstaff (base amount, 1d6 points), with additions to attack and damage rolls based upon its magical bonus.

'''Scimitar of Speed:''' This is a magical weapon, usually of +2 bonus, that automatically grants its wielder the first attack in a melee round, even though some magical effect might have otherwise slowed his speed and reaction time. It also allows more than one strike in some rounds, increasing the wielder’s figure for attacks per melee round by one place, so that if one attack is normal, the improved figure is three attacks every two rounds, and if three/two is normal, then the improvement is to two attacks per round. This increase in attacks is cumulative with any other bonus attacks (such as those provided by a ''haste'' spell).

The order of attacks in the round is determined normally after the wielder of the ''scimitar of speed'' has made his first attack to begin activity in the round. It is possible, for instance, that a wielder entitled to three attacks in the round will attack once betore any other action takes place, and then (because of poor initiative rolls or other factors) take his remaining two attacks at the very end of the round.

There is a chance (25%) that the weapon will have a bonus of something other than +2; if this occurs, roll percentile dice and refer to the following table to determine the appropriate bonus:

'''Sling of Seeking +2:''' This gives its user a +2 bonus for both attack and damage rolls, but missiles from such a weapon are regarded as +1 with respect to whether or not certain creatures are affected by the weapon (i.e., a special defense of “+1 or better weapon to hit” means the creature is vulnerable to normal missiles from this sling).

'''Spear, Cursed Backbiter:''' This is to all tests a magical spear with a +1 bonus (or at the DM’s option +2 or +3). lt may even function normally in combat against a deadly enemy, but each time it is used in melee against a foe, there is a one in 20 cumulative chance that it will function against its wielder. Once it begins functioning in this way, you can’t get rid of it without a ''remove curse'' spell, The character always seems to find the spear in his hand despite his best efforts or intentions.

When the curse takes effect, the spear curls around to strike its wielder in the back, negating any shield and Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class, and inflicting normal damage, The curse even functions when the spear is hurled, but if the wielder has hurled the spear, the damage done to the hurler will be double. Once the spear has returned to him, the character will again find himself compelled to use the spear.

'''Sun Blade:''' This sword is the size of a bastard sword. However, its enchantment enables the ''sun blade'' to be wielded as if it werea short sword with respect to encumbrance, weight, speed factor, and ease of use (i.e., the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard sword, and inflicts bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and reacts as if the weapon were a short sword). Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a ''sun blade''.

In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a +2 sword. Against evil creatures, its bonus is +4. Against Negative Material plane creatures or those drawing power from that plane (such as certain undead), the sword inflicts double damage.

Furthermore, the blade has a special ''sunray'' power, Once a day, upon command, the blade can be swung vigorously above the head, and it will shed a bright yellow radiance that is like full daylight, The radiance begins shining in a 10’ radius around the sword-wielder, spreading outward at S’ per round for 10 rounds thereafter, creating a globe of light with a 60° radius. When the swinging stops, the radiance tades to a dim glow that persists for another turn before disappearing entirely. All ''sun blades'' are of good alignment.

'''Sword +1, +2 vs. magic-using and enchanted creatures:''' This sword always provides a +1 bonus. The +2 bonus takes effect when the sword is employed against wizards, monsters that can cast spells, and conjured, created, gated, or summoned creatures. Note that the +2 bonus would not operate against a creature magically empowered by an item (such as a ''ring of spell storing'') to cast spells.

'''Sword +1, +3 vs. lycanthropes and shape changers:''' This gives its +3 against werecreatures—those able to assume the form of another creature (such as a vampire or a druid), or any creature under the influence of a ''polymorph'' or ''shape change'' spell.

'''Sword +1, +3 vs. regenerating creatures:''' This will give the +3 bonus to its wielder even when the regenerating creature does so because of a magical device—such as a ''ring of regeneration''.

'''Sword +1, +4 vs. reptiles:''' This gives the +4 against such creatures as dinosaurs, dragons, hydras, lizards, snakes, wyverns, etc.

'''Sword +1, cursed:''' This performs in all respects asa +1 weapon, but when its wielder is faced by an enemy, the sword will weld itself to the character’s hand and force him to fight until the enemy or the wielder is slain. Thereafter, the possessor can loose, but never rid himself of, the cursed sword. No matter what is done, it will appear in his hand whenever an opponent is faced, The character can be freed of the weapon only by a ''remove curse'' spell.

'''Sword +1, flame tongue, +2 vs. regenerating creatures, +3 vs. cold-using, inflammable, or avian creatures, +4 vs. undead:''' This sheds light when its possessor speaks a command word or phrase. When activated, the ''flame tongue'' sword’s fire illuminates the area as brightly as a torch. The flame from this sword easily ignites oil, burns webs, or sets fire to paper, parchment, dry wood, etc. Cold-using creatures are those whose attack mode involves cold (ice toads, white dragons, winter wolves, yeti, etc.).

'''Sword +1, Luck Blade:''' This gives its possessor a *1 bonus to all saving throws and will have d4 +1 ''wishes''. The DM should keep the number of wishes secret.

'''Sword +2, Dragon Slayer:''' This has a +4 bonus against any sort of true dragon. It inflicts triple damage against one sort of dragon (i.e., 3d12+4). Note that an unusual sword with intelligence and alignment will not be made to slay dragons of the same alignment. Determine dragon type (excluding unique ones like Bahamut and Tiamat) by rolling 1d10:

'''Sword +2, Giant Slayer:''' This provides a +3 bonus versus any giant, giant kin ettin, ogre mage, Or titan. Against any of the true giants (hill, stone, frost, fire, cloud, storm) the sword causes double damage (i.e,, 2d12 + 3).

'''Sword, Short, of Quickness:''' This is a special +2 blade that enables the wielder to strike first in every combat round, lf the wielder encounters someone with a similar weapon (e.g., a ''scimitar of speed''), both strike simultaneously,

'''Sword +2, Nine Lives Stealer:''' This will always perform as a +2 weapon, but it also has the power to draw the life force from an opponent. It can do this nine times before the ability is lost. A natural 20 must be scored on the wielder’s attack roll for the sword to function, The victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. If this succeeds, the sword does not function, no charge is used, and normal damage is determined.

'''Sword +3, Frost Brand, +6 vs. fire-using/dwelling creatures:''' This sword always provides a +3 bonus.’ The +6 bonus takes effect against creatures that use fire or live in fiery environments. The weapon does not shed any light, except when the air temperature is below 0 degrees F. It does give special benefits againsttire, for its wielder is protected as if he were wearing a ''ring of fire resistance''.

The ''frost brand'' sword also has a 50% chance of extinguishing any fire into which its blade is thrust. This power extends to a 10’ radius—including a ''wall of fire'' but excluding a ''fireball'', ''meteor swarm'', or ''flame strike''.

'''Sword, +4 Defender:''' This gives its wielder the option of using all, some, or none of the +4 bonus in defense (improving his Armor Class) against any opponent using a hand-held weapon, such as a dagger, mace, spear (not hurled), sword, etc. For example, the wielder can, on the first round of battle, opt to use the sword as +2 and save the other two bonus factors to be added to his Armor Class. This can be done each round.

Note that there is also a ''sword, +5 defender'', This is identical to the +4 sword with one extra bonus point.

'''Sword, +5 Holy Avenger:''' In the hands of any character other than a paladin, this holy sword will perform only as a ''sword +2'', In the hands of a paladin, however, it creates a magic resistance of 50% ina 5’ radius, dispels magic in a 5’ radius at the level of magic use equal to the experience level of the paladin, and inflicts +10 points of bonus damage upon chaotic evil opponents.

'''Sword -2, cursed:''' This is a sword that gives off a magical aura and performs well against targets in practice, but when it is used against an opponent in combat it lowers its user’s attack rolls by -2. Only by careful observation can this lowering be detected.

All damage scored is reduced by two hit points, but never below a one in any event. The sword will always force the character to employ it against enemies, appearing in the character’s hand. It can be gotten rid of only by means of ''limited wish'' or ''wish''.

'''Sword of Dancing:''' On the first round of melee this weapon is +1, on the second +2, on the third +3, and on the fourth it is +4, On the fifth round, it drops back to +1 and the cycle begins again. In addition, after four rounds of melee its wielder can opt to allow it to “dance.”

Dancing consists of loosing the sword on any round (after the first) when its bonus is +1. The sword then fights on its own at the same level of experience as its wielder. After four rounds of dancing, the sword returns to its wielder, who must hold it (and use it) for four rounds before it can dance again, In other words, it is loosed to dance for four rounds, going from +1 to +4, and must then be held by its wielder at a +1 state and physically used for four successive rounds of melee combat.

When dancing, the sword will leave its owner’s hand and may go up to 30’ distant. At the end of its fourth round of solo combat, it will move to its possessor’s hand automatically. Note that when dancing the sword cannot be physically hit, although certain magical attacks such as a ''fireball'', ''lightning bolt'', or ''transmute metal to wood'' spell could affect it.

Finally, remember that the ''dancing sword'' fights alone at the same level (and class) as its possessor—if a 4th-level fighter, the sword tights alone exactly the same: if a 7th-level thief is the wielder, the sword will so fight when dancing. Relieved of his weapon for four melee rounds, the possessor may act in virtually any manner desired—resting, discharging missiles, drawing another weapon and engaging in handto-hand combat, etc.—as long as he remains within 30’ of the sword. If he movesIntelligent Weapons more than 30’ from the weapon, it falls lifeless to the ground and is a +1 weapon when again grasped.

'''Sword of Wounding:''' This is a sword of only +1 bonus, but any hit made with it cannot be healed by ''regeneration''. In subsequent rounds, the opponent so wounded loses one additional hit point for each wound inflicted by the sword.

Thus, an opponent hit for four points of damage on the first melee round will automatically lose one additional hit point on the second and each successive round of combat. Loss of the extra point stops only when the creature so wounded bandages its wound or after 10 melee rounds (one turn).

Damage from a ''sword of wounding'' can be healed only by normal means (rest and time), never by potion, spell, or other magical means short of a ''wish''. Note that successive wounds will damage in the same manner as the first.

'''Sword of Life Stealing:''' This +2 weapon will eliminate one level of experience (or Hit Die) and accompanying hit points and abilities when it strikes any opponent on a natural roll of 20. This function is the same as the leveldraining ability of certain undead creatures.

The sword wielder can gain as many hit points as an opponent loses to this function of the weapon, up to the maximum number of hit points the character is allowed (i.e., only a character who has suffered loss of hit points can benefit from the function).

'''Sword of Sharpness:''' This weapon is treated as +3 or better for purposes of who or what can be hit by it, even though it gets only a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. Its power is great, however, for on a very high attack roll, it will sever an extremity—arm, leg, neck, tail, tentacle, whatever (but not head)—determined by random dice roll:
{| class="wikitable"
	! Opponent is
	! Modified score to sever*
	|-
	| normal/armored
	| 19-21
	|-
	| larger than man-sized
	| 20-21
	|-
	| Solid metal or stone
	| 21
|}
&#42; Considering only the sword’s bonus of +1.

A ''sword of sharpness'' will respond to its wielder’s desire with respect to the light it sheds—none, a 5’ circle of dim illumination, a 15’ light, or a 30’ radius glow equal to a ''light'' spell.

'''Sword, Vorpal:''' Similar but superior to a ''sword of sharpness'', a vorpal weapon has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls. Check the table below to determine whether an attack roll is good enough to sever the neck/head of the opponent:
{| class="wikitable"
	! Opponent is
	! Modified score to sever*
	|-
	| normal/armored
	| 20-23
	|-
	| larger than man-sized
	| 21-23
	|-
	| solid metal or stone
	| 22-23
|}
&#42; Considering only the sword’s bonus of +3.

Note that many creatures have no heads or can change their form and, therefore, cannot suffer decapitation, There are also creatures that have heads but will not necessarily be killed by decapitation (among these are dopplegangers, elementals, and golems).

'''Sword of the Planes:''' This magical weapon has a base bonus of +1 on the Prime Material plane, but on any inner plane its bonus increases to +2. (The +2 bonus also applies on the Prime Material plane when the weapon is used against ''opponents'' from the inner planes.) Similarly, when used on an outer plane or against creatures from the outer planes, the sword becomes a +3 weapon, Finally, it operates as a +4 weapon on the Astral or Ethereal plane or when used against opponents from either of those planes.

'''Sword, Cursed Berserking:''' This performs by every test, save that of the heat of battle, as a +2 magical sword of some sort. However, in actual battle its wielder will go berserk, attacking the nearest creature and continuing to fight until dead or until no living thing remains within 60’. The sword has a +2 bonus and otherwise acts as a ''cursed sword +1'', The possessor of a ''cursed berserking sword'' can be rid of it only if it is exorcised via a ''remove curse'' spell or wish.

'''Trident of Submission:''' A weapon of this nature appears unremarkable, exactly as any normal trident. The wielder of a ''trident of submission'' causes any opponent struck to save vs. spell, If the opponent fails to save, it must check morale the next round ''instead'' of attacking: if morale is good, the opponent may act normally next round, but if it is poor, the opponent will cease fighting and surrender, overcome with a feeling of hopelessness. The duration of this hopelessness is 2-8 rounds. Thereafter the creature is normal once again. The trident has 17-20 charges. A trident of this type isa +1 magical weapon.

'''Trident of Fish Command:''' This three-tined fork atop a stout rod 6’ long appears to be a barbed military fork of some sort. However, its magical properties enable its wielder to cause all fish within a 60’ radius to roll saving throws vs. spell. This uses one charge of the trident. Fish failing this throw are completely under empathic command and will not attack the possessor of the trident nor any creature within 10’ of him. The wielder of the device can cause fish to move in whatever direction is desired and can convey messages of emotion (i.e., fear, hunger, anger, indifference, repletion, etc.). Fish making their saving throw are free of empathic control, but they will not approach within 10’ of the trident.

In addition to ordinary fish, the trident affects sharks and eels. It doesn’t affect mollusks, crustaceans, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and similar sorts of non-piscine marine creatures. A school of fish should be checked as a single entity.

A trident of this type contains 1d4+16 charges. It is otherwise a +1 magical weapon.

'''Trident of Warning:''' A weapon of this type enables its wielder to determine the location, depth, species, and number of hostile and/or hungry marine predators within 240’. A ''trident of warning'' must be grasped and pointed in order for the person using it to gain such information, and it requires one round to scan a hemisphere with a radius of 240 feet. There are 19-24 charges in a trident of this type, each charge sufficient to last for two rounds of scanning. The weapon is otherwise a +2 magical weapon.

'''Trident of Yearning:''' A ''trident of yearning'' looks exactly like any normal trident, and its aura is indistinguishable from that of other enchanted weapons of this sort. Any character grasping this type of trident immediately feels an overwhelming desire to immerse himself in as great a depth of water as possible. This unquenchable longing causes the affected character to proceed immediately toward the largest/deepest body of water—in any event, one that is sufficient to completely cover his or her person. Once there, he will immerse himself permanently.

The character cannot loose his grip on the trident, and only a ''water breathing'' spell (after submersion) or a ''wish'' will enable the character to do so. The trident is otherwise a -2 cursed magical weapon. Note that this itern does not confer the ability to breathe underwater.

== Intelligent Weapons ==
Tables 113 through 119 should be used to determine the properties of an intelligent weapon: the number of powers, unusual properties, alignment, and special purpose of the item (if any). Such weapons are useful to give higher-level fighters some additional tactical options and limiteduse special abilities.

The DM is encouraged to design unusual magical weapons along special themes and for specific campaign purposes, using the tables as guidelines and for inspiration. Just because a power is rolled doesn’t mean it must be given out. If the DM feels a combination is too bizarre or powerful, he can simply change or ignore it.

The first step in creating an intelligent weapon is to determine its general capabilities. These are found by rolling 1d100 on Table 113. Then, move onto Tables 114-118 until all the capabilities of the weapon have been specified.

=== Intelligent Weapon Alignment ===
Any weapon with intelligence will have an alignment. Note that ''holy avenger'', swords have alignment restrictions, All cursed weapons are absolutely neutral.

{| class="wikitable"
	|+Table 114: WEAPON ALIGNMENT
	! D100 Roll
	! Alignment of Weapon
	|-
	| 01-05
	| Chaotic good
	|-
	| 06-15
	| Chaotic neutral*
	|-
	| 16-20
	| Chaotic evil
	|-
	| 21-25
	| Neutral evil*
	|-
	| 26-30
	| Lawful evil
	|-
	| 31-55
	| Lawful good
	|-
	| 56-60
	| Lawful neutral*
	|-
	| 61-80
	| Neutral (absolute)
	|-
	| 81-00
	| Neutral good*
|}
&#42; The item can also be used by any character whose alignment corresponds to the nonneutral alignment portion of the weapon’s alignment (i.e., chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). Thus any chaotic character can use a weapon with chaotic neutral alignment.

Any character whose alignment does not correspond to that of the weapon, except as noted by the asterisk above, will sustain points of damage equal to the number of ego points (see Table 119) of the weapon. This damage is suffered every time (or for every round) the character touches any portion of the weapon unless the weapon is in the grasp or possession of a character whose alignment is compatible with the weapon.

=== Weapon Abilities ===
Using the number of capabilities determined by Table 113, the weapon’s specific abilities are determined by rolling on the appropriate tables below.

{| class="wikitable"
	|+Table 115: WEAPON PRIMARY ABILITIES
	! D100 Roll
	! Ability
	|-
	| 01-11
	| Detect “elevator” /shifting rooms/walls in a 10’ radius
	|-
	| 12-22
	| Detect sloping passages in a 10’ radius
	|-
	| 23-33
	| Detect traps of large size in a 10’ radius
	|-
	| 34-44
	| Detect evil/good in a 10’ radius
	|-
	| 45-55
	| Detect precious metals, kind, and amount in a 20’ radius
	|-
	| 56-66
	| Detect gems, kind, and number in a 5’ radius

	| 93-98
	| Roll twice on this table ignoring scores of 93 to 00
	|-
	| 99-00
	| Roll on Table 116 instead
|}

If the same ability is rolled twice or more, range of the power is double, triple, etc. All abilities function only when the weapon is held, drawn, and the possessor is concentrating on the desired result. A weapon can perform only one function at a time, and thus can fight or detect but one thing at a time. Other abilities can be created by the DM.

&#42; Saving throws apply as usual

If the same power is rolled twice, the uses/day are doubled, etc.

Powers function only when the weapon is drawn and held and the possessor is concentrating upon the desired effect, Most powers require that the character stop and concentrate for a full round.

Purpose must suit the type and alignment of the weapon in question. Killing is always restricted to evil when the weapon is of good alignment. Weapons dedicated to slaying monsters will always be either good and slay neutral or evil monsters, or evil and slay neutral or good monsters.

&#42; Upon scoringa hit with the weapon unless the opponent succeeds with a saving throw vs. spell.

The DM should determine languages spoken by the weapon based on his campaign and the history of the weapon. Thus, an intelligent warhammer fashioned by the dwarves would certainly understand dwarven as one of its powers.

&#42; Or the result of 2 additional rolls ignoring a score of 00, whichever is the greater.

=== Weapon Ego ===
Only after all aspects of a weapon have been determined and recorded can the ego rating of a weapon be found. Ego, along with intelligence, will be a factor with regard to the dominance of weapon over character, as detailed on Table 119.
{| class="wikitable"
	|+Table 119: WEAPON EGO
	! Attribute of Weapon
	! Ego Points
	|-
	| Each + of weapon*
	| 1
	|-
	| Each primary ability**
	| 1
	|-
	| Each extraordinary power**
	| 2
	|-
	| Special purpose
	| 5

	|-
	| Telepathic ability
	| 2
	|-
	| Reading languages ability

	|-
	| Reading magic ability
	| 2
|}
&#42; Thus, asword +1 has one ego point, but if it has another (higher) plus, these are also counted. For example, a flame tongue +1 hasa maximum plus of 4, so it is +1/ +4 for five ego points. In addition, weapons that have no extra pluses but extra powers (holy avenger, sharpness, etc.) add double their + rating for ego.<br/>
&#42;&#42; If double ability, double ego points.

=== Weapons Versus Characters ===
When a weapon possesses unusual characteristics, it has a ''personality'', which is rated by combining its intelligence and ego scores. The weapon will, of course, be absolutely true to its alignment, and if the character who possesses the weapon is not, personality conflict—weapon versus character—will result.

Similarly, any weapon with an ego of 19 or higher will always consider itself superior to any character, and a personality conflict will result if the possessor does not always agree with the weapon.

The ''personality score'' of a character is:

Intelligence + Charisma + Exper. Level

Note that the personality score is reduced by one for every group of hit points of damage taken equal to the character’s average number of points per level. Divide the character’s total hit points by his level (round up). For example: A fighter of 7th level has 53 hit points: 53 ÷ 7 = 7.6. Thus for every eight points of damage he suffers, his personality score will be lowered by one.

Whenever personality conflict occurs, the weapon will resist the character’s desires and demand concessions such as:
# Removal of associates, henchmen, hirelings, or creatures of alignment or personality distasteful to the weapon
# The character divesting himself of all other magical weapons
# Obedience from the character so weapon can lead the expedition for its own purposes
# Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the weapon
# Encrustation of pommel, hilt, scabbard, baldric, or belt with gems and a special container made of precious substances for its safekeeping.
# Magical protections and devices to protect it from molestation when not in use
# That the character pay it handsomely for all abilities and powers the weapon is called upon to exercise in behalf of its possessor
# That the character carry it with him on all occasions
# That the character relinquish the weapon in favor of a more suitable person due to alignment differences or conduct

Any time the personality score of a weapon exceeds the personality score of the character who possesses it, the weapon will dominate its possessor, and it can force any or all of the above demands or actually cause any of the following actions:
# Force its possessor into combat
# Refuse to strike opponents
# Strike at its wielder or his associates
# Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent
# Cause itself to drop from the character’s grasp

Naturally, such actions are unlikely where the character-weapon alignment and purposes are harmonious. However, the weapon might well wish to have a lesser character possess it 60 as to easily command him, or a higher level possessor so as to better accomplish its goals.

All magical weapons with personalities will desire to play an important role in the success of activities, particularly combat. Such weapons are rivals of each other, even if of the same alignment. They will be aware of the presence of any similar weapon within 60’, and try their best to lead a possessor into missing or destroying the rival unless this is totally inimical to its nature—a ''holy avenger'', for example, would certainly not allow destruction of any other lawful good weapon and might encourage their discovery, even at the risk of having to face grim odds to do so.

Weapons of this nature will never be totally controlled or silenced by the characters who possess them, even though they may be heavily outweighed by personality force. They may be powerless to force their demands, but they will be in there plugging. Even a humble +1 weapon of unusual nature can be a vocal martyr, denigrating its own abilities and asking only that the character only give it the chance to shatter itself against some hated enemy, etc.

Note: Most players will be unwilling to play weapons with personalities as the personalities dictate. It is incumbent upon the DM to ensure that the role of the weapon is played to the hilt, so to speak, with the DM assuming the persona of the weapon if necessary.
