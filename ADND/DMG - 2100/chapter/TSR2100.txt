== Foreword ==
A foreword is normally the place where the author of a book expresses thanks and gratitude. I’m not going to do that here. It’s not that everyone involved doesn’t deserve congratulations and praise, it’s just that I already said all those things in the foreword to the AD&D® 2nd Edition Player’s Handbook. Everything I said there is true for this book, too. On to other things.

Let’s assume that since you’re reading this, you are, or plan to be, a DUNGEONMASTER™. By now, you should be familiar with the rules in the Player’s Handbook. You’ve probably already noticed things you like or things you would have done differently. If you have, congratulations. You’ve got the spirit every Dungeon Master needs. Curiosity and the desire to make changes, to do things differently because your idea is better than the other guy’s—these are the most important things a Dungeon Master needs. As you go through this rule book, I encourage you to continue to make these choices.

 and everyone working on the AD&D 2nd Edition game have had to make fundamental decisions, but we’ve tried to avoid being dogmatic and inflexible. The AD&D game is yours, it’s mine, it’s every player’s game.

So is there an “official” AD&D game? Yes, but only when there needs to be. Although I don’t have a crystal ball, it’s likely that tournaments and other official events will use all of the core rules in these books. Optional rules may or may not be used, but it’s fair to say that all players need to know about them even if they don’t have them memorized.

The ''Player’s Handbook'' and the ''DUNGEON MASTER™ Guide'' give you what you’re expected to know, but that doesn’t mean the game begins and ends there. Your game will go in directions not yet explored and your players will try things others think strange. Sometimes these strange things will work; sometimes they won’t. Just accept this, be ready for it, and enjoy it.

Take the time to have fun with the AD&D rules. Add, create, expand, and extrapolate. Don’t just let the game sit there, and don’t become a rules lawyer worrying about each piddly little detail. If you can’t figure out the answer, MAKE IT UP! And whatever you do, don’t fall into the trap of believing these rules are complete. They are not. You cannot sit back and let the rule book do everything for you. Take the time and effort to become not just a good DM”, but a brilliant one.

 come back with a question—what do you feel is right? And the people asking the questions discover that not only can they create an answer, but that their answer is as good as anyone else’s. The rules are only guidelines.

At the beginning of the first ''DUNGEON MASTER™ Guide'', Gary Gygax stressed that each of us, working from a common base, would make the AD&D game grow in a variety of different directions. That is more true today than ever. Don’t be afraid of experimentation, but do be careful. As a Dungeon Master, you have great power, and “with great power comes great responsibility.” Use it wisely.
