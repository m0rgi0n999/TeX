The new Monstrous Compendium format was designed with the
Dungeon Master in mind. Monster entries are given in alphabetical order,
printed on looseleaf sheets that can be organized for convenience. The
sheets needed for an adventure can be placed in a separate folder for play,
then later returned to the master binder. New monsters can be easily
placed in the master binder.

All monsters described here are typical for their type; likewise, the
given encounter tables are guidelines for general play. DMs should note
that unusual variations are encouraged, but are most effective when they
depart from the expected.

Each monster is described fully, with entries that describe behavior,
combat modes, and so on. These are explained below.

CLIMATE/TERRAIN defines where the creature is most often found. Cli-
mates include arctic, subarctic, temperate, and tropical. Typical terrain
includes plain/scrub, forest, rough/hill, mountain, swamp, and desert.

FREQUENCY is the likelihood of encountering a creature in an area. Very
rare is a 4% chance, rare is 11%, uncommon is 20%, and common is a
65% chance. Chances can be adjusted for special areas.

ORGANIZATION is the general social structure the monster adopts.
“Solitary” includes small family groups.

ACTIVE CYCLE is the time of day when the monster is most active. Those
most active at night may be active at any time in subterranean settings.
Active cycle is a general guide and exceptions are fairly common.

DIET shows what the creature generally eats. Carnivores eat meat, her-
bivores eat plants, and omnivores eat either. Scavengers eat mainly car-
tion.

INTELLIGENCE is the equivalent of human “IQ”. Certain monsters are
instinctively cunning; these are noted in the monster descriptions. Ratings
correspond roughly to the following Intelligence ability scores:

0 Non-intelligent or not ratable
A Animal intelligence
2-4 Semi-intelligent
5-7 _ Low intelligence
8-10 Average (human) intelligence
11-12 ‘Very intelligent
13-14 Highly intelligent
15-16 Exceptionally intelligent
17-18 Genius
19-20 Supra-genius
21+ — Godlike intelligence

TREASURE refers to the treasure tables in the Dungeon Masters Guide. If
individual treasure is indicated, each individual may carry it (or not, at
the DM's discretion). Major treasures are usually found in the monster's
lair; these are most often designed and placed by the DM. Intelligent mon-
sters will use magical items present and try to carry off their most valuable
treasures if hard pressed. If treasure is assigned randomly, roll for each
type possible: if all rolls fail, no treasure of any type is found. Treasure
should be adjusted downward if few monsters are encountered. Large
treasures are noted by a parenthetical multiplier (x 10, etc.)—not to be
confused with treasure type X. Do not use the tables to place dungeon
treasure, as numbers encountered underground will be much smaller.

ALIGNMENT shows the general behavior of the average monster of that
type. Exceptions, though uncommon, may be encountered.

NO. APPEARING indicates an average encounter size for a wilderness
encounter, The DM should alter this to fit the circumstances as the need
arises. This should not be used for dungeon encounters.

ARMOR CLASS is the general protection worn by humans and human-
oids, protection due to physical structure or magical nature, or difficulty
in hitting due to speed, re! , etc. Humans and humanoids of roughly
man-size that wear armor will have an unarmored rating in parentheses.
Listed AC do not include any special bonuses noted in the description.

MOVEMENT shows the relative speed rating of the creature. Higher
speeds may be possible for short periods. Human, demihuman, and hu-
manoid movement rate is often determined by armor type (unarmored
rates are given in parentheses). Movements in different mediums are ab-
breviated as follows: Fl = fly, Sw = swim, Br = burrowing, Wb = web.

Flying creatures will also have a Maneuverability Class from A to E.

HIT DICE controls the number of hit points damage a creature can with-
stand before being killed. Unless otherwise stated, Hit Dice are 8-sided
(1-8 hit points). The Hit Dice are rolled and the numbers shown are added
to determine the monster's hit points. Some monsters will have a hit point
spread instead of Hit Dice, and some will have additional points added to
their Hit Dice. Thus, a creature with 4 +4 Hit Dice has 4d8 +4 hit points
(8-36 total). Note that creatures with +3 or more hit points are considered
the next higher Hit Die for purposes of attack rolls and saving throws.

THACO is the attack roll the monster needs to hit armor class 0. This is al-
ways a function of Hit Dice, except in the case of very large, non-
aggressive herbivores (such as some dinosaurs). Humans and
demihumans always use player character THACOs, regardless of whether
they are player characters or “monsters”. THACOs do not include any
special bonuses noted in the descriptions.

NUMBER OF ATTACKS shows the basic attacks the monster can make in
a melee round, excluding special attacks. This number can be modified by
hits that sever members, spells such as haste and slow, and so forth. Mul-
tiple attacks indicate several members, raking paws, multiple heads, etc.

DAMAGE PER ATTACK shows the amount of damage a given attack will
make, expressed as a spread of hit points (dice roll combination). If the
monster uses weapons, the damage will done by the typical weapon will
be followed by the parenthetical note “weapon”. Damage bonuses due to
Strength are listed as a bonus following the damage range.

SPECIAL ATTACKS detail attack modes such as dragon breath, magic
use, etc. These are explained in the monster description.

SPECIAL DEFENSES are precisely that, and are detailed in the monster
description.

MAGIC RESISTANCE is the percentage chance that magic cast upon the
creature will fail to affect it, even if other creatures nearby are affected. If
the magic penetrates the resistance, the creature is still entitled to any nor-
mal saving throw allowed.

SIZE is abbreviated as: “T,” tiny (2' tall or less); “S,” smaller than a typical
human (2 +’ to 4’); “M,” man-sized (4+' to 7’); “L,” larger than man-sized
(7+! to 12'); “Hy” huge (12+! to 25’); and “G,” gargantuan (25 +’).

 

 

MORALE is a general rating of how likely the monster is to persevere in
the face of adversity or armed opposition. This guideline can be adjusted
for individual circumstances. Morale ratings correspond to the following
2-20 range:

2-4 Unreliable

5-7 Unsteady
8-10 Average
11-12 Steady
13-14 Elite
15-16 Champion
17-18 Fanatic
19-20 Fearless

XP VALUE is the number of experience points awarded for defeating (not
neccessarily killing) the monster. This value is a guideline that can be
modified by the DM for the degree of challenge, encounter situation, and
for overall campaign balance.

Combat is the part of the description that discusses special combat abili-
ties, arms and armor, and tactics.

Habitat/Society outlines the monster's general behavior, nature, social
structure, and goals.

Ecology describes how the monster fits into the campaign world, gives
any useful products or byproducts, and presents other miscellaneous in-
formation.

Close variations of a monster (e.g. merrow, ogre) are given in a special
section after the main monster entry. These can be found by consulting the
index to find the major listing.
ALPHABETICAL INDEX TO MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM 1

Monster names are listed in the first column, with the monster page with the description in the second column. Alternative names are given in italics in the first
column. In the second column, monster sub-sections are given in italics. Comp. identifies the Monstrous Compendium volume the monster appears in.

AERIAL ENCOUNTERS: This type of
encounter occurs only if the encounter

result was “DM Special”. The DM se-
lects an appropriate aerial encounter
from the italicized listings in the either
the terrain type or DM Special table.

WATERBORNE ENCOUNTERS: Un-
intelligent monsters are 75% likely to
be driven off by flaming oil nearby,
90% if actually burned by it. Large
amounts of food thrown overboard are
50% likely to end such encounters.

A navigational hazard will ground or
damage a vessel that does not have a
pilot familiar with the waters. Such
hazards as sandbars and submerged
logs often appear at random.

ay. ENCOUNTERS: This
table is most useful for otherwise un-
developed towns and cities. Random
encounters not appropriate to the
quarter or location are ignored. In
general, appearances will often be de-
ceptive until the party interacts ver-
bally with those encountered.

‘Assassin encounters will generally be
with 1-3 paid killers, more if in the
Thieves’ Quarter. Player characters may
either be the intended targets or may be
in a position to foil the attempt.
Bandit encounters (nighttime) will
typically be with 3-12 bandits, with 1
or more leaders. In daytime, the group
will be nondescript.
Beggar encounters are usually with 1
person. A beggar has a slight (1% to
8%) chance of knowing information
of value to the character, but payment
must be made. Any payment or gift
will immediately attract the attention
of 09 . In some cities,
the beggars have a guild as powerful as
the Thieves’ Guild.

encounters are with 2-16
mercenary soldiers who serve as wall
and gate guards or as police. Leaders
will be of 2nd to Sth level; 2 are
present if more than 8 guards, 3 if
more than 12. Each party will be ac-
companied by a wizard of Ist to 4th
levels, indentured for a year (for bad
debts, resurrection, violation of city
tules, non-payment of taxes, etc.)
City officialencounters will usually be
with a minor bureaucrat such as a tax
collector, customs officer, guard or
watch lieutenant, deputy baliff, or as-
sistant magistrate. Such will have 1-4
personal guards. A 10% chance for an
encounter with a major official exists,
such as meetings with a steward, al-
derman, justice, watch captain, cham-

berlain, or magistrate. Major officials
will have 2-8 guards. Officials will re-
sent unwarrented intrusion, but will
speak with persons regarding impor-
tant matters.
City watch encounters are with squads
of watchmen (S men plus a Ist-3rd
level sergeant in day; double numbers
plus a 4th or Sth level lieutenant at
night). These squads will be accompa-
nied by an indentured cleric of 2nd to
Sth level. They act similarly to city
guards, and at night these patrols will
be ready to aid attacked persons and
arrest lawbreakers.
Courtesans Will often be difficult to
tell from goodwives, gentlewomen, or
nobility—at least at first glance. The
courtesan is 30% likely to have infor-
mation of value, 15% likely to make
something up to gain a reward, 20%
likely to be (or work with) a thief, and
10% likely to be a spy in the employ of
a special interest group.
Drunk encounters will typically be
with 1-4 tipsy revelers (50% ) or wine-
sodden bums (50%). Revelers can be
of any class or station.
Gambler encounters will be with 1-4
street gamblers or gamblers on their way
toa gaming house. The head gambler is
20% likely to know significant informa-
tion about that quarter of the city.
Gentleman encounters are with a fop-
pish dandy and 1-4 sycophants (40% ),
a gentlewoman (20%), or a well-
dressed fighter of 7th to 10th level and
1-4 friends with similar abilities
(40%). Any rude remarks give of-
fense. Fops will cause trouble with city
officials, gentlewomen will send a
champion, fighters will challenge of-
fenders.
GhasvGhoul encounters occur near
charnel houses, graveyards, etc.
Ghasts number 2-8, while ghouls
number 4-16,

counters are with a single
townswoman. About 20% know in-
teresting gossip. Offensive treatment
or seeming threats are likely to cause
the goodwife to scream for help, ac-
cusing the offender of assault, theft,
murder, etc,
Laborerencounters are with 3-12 non-
descript persons, loitering or going to
work. They will be rough brawlers,
and each has a 10% chance to be a
levy of the city watch, with appropri-
ate knowledge and connections.
Mercenary encounters are with 3-12
nondescript men. There is a 30%

chance they are available for hire.
Merchant encounters will be with 1 to 3
merchants. About 10% of these will be
0 rich as to be indistiguishable from no-
bles or city officials, Merchants are 10%
likely to have useful knowledge for a
price. At night, in dangerous sections of
the city, merchants will be accompanied
by 2-8 guards.

NPC notables are higher level charac-
ters either residing in or passing
though the town. Their descriptions
and backgrounds are up to the DM.

Fighters will be 6th-12th level and
have 0-3 henchmen of levels 1-4.

Rangers will be 7th-10th level and
will look like other fighters.

Paladins will be 6th-9th level and
will look like other fighters.

Wizards will be 7th-12th level. They
will have 0-5 henchmen, either ap-
prentices of levels 1-6 (30% chance),
fighters of levels 4-7 (40% chance), 1
of each (10%), or 2 of each (20%).
Wizards desire privacy.

Priests will be 6th-11th level. There
will be 0-5 lesser priests of levels 1-4.
Encountered priests may ask for con-
tributions or try to convert the party.

Druids dislike towns and will likely
shun others unless they have common
interests or pressing business.

Thieves will be 8th-11th level. This
single wandering thief is 10% likely to
be spying for a city faction.

Bards will be 7th-10th level. The
bard has 10% chance of knowing im-
mediately worthwhile information,
and a 5% chance to be carrying a se-
cret message of importance.

Noble encounters can be with noble-
men (75%) or noblewomen (25%).
Noblemen will have at least 1-4 guards
and 1-2 servants. Noblemen are 50%
likely to be either fighters of Sth to
12th level (80% chance) or clerics of
Sth to 12th level (20% chance). Noble-
‘women usually have a sedan chair and
carriers (and linkboys at night). Any
disrespect or insult to a noble will be
taken seriously.

Peddlerencounters are with 1-3 wan-
dering sellers of common goods. They
are 20% likely to have gossip or infor-
mation available for a price, About
5% of peddlers are actually spies.
Pilgrimencounters are with 3-12 non-
descript persons travelling to a reli-
gious or quasi-religious site. The
alignment of all group members is the
same. For every 4 pilgrims, there will
be one of unusual type (cleric, fighter,
etc.). Note that they can be confused

with other groups (laborers, bandits,
etc.). A group of pilgrims has a 5%
chance of having some ulterior motive
(spies, assassins, etc.),

Press gang encounters are with 2-16
burly soldiers or sailors, armed with
swords, but wielding clubs, and with a
leader of 2nd-Sth level. Outnumbered or
incapacitated characters may be “shang-
haied” into the local militia or navy.
Rake encounters are with 2-5 young
gentlemen fighters of Sth to 10th level.
They will be aggressive, rude, and sar-
castic. They are also 25% likely to be
drunk.

Rat, giant. These inhabit their own
tunneled warrens in sewers, cellars,
etc. In daylight, 2-8 rats will be found
in dim alleys or darkened buildings.
At night, 4-24 will be encountered.
Ruffian encounters will be with 7 to 12
fellows of shabby appearance and
mean disposition. They are armed
with clubs and daggers, fighting as
2nd level fighters and having 2 Hit
Dice (d8). There is a 5% chance per
ruffian that a leader of 4th to 7th level
will be present (35%-60% chance).
Thiefencounters will be with an 8th to
‘1th level thief, with 0-2 apprentices
of Ist to 4th level. If alone, the thief
will be a wandering adventurer. If
with apprentices, the thief will be
“working”, on Guild business, or
both. Working thieves often disguise
themselves as beggars.

Tradesman encounters will be with 2
to 8 nondescript workers (smiths,
coopers, etc.) going about their busi-
ness. They are valued citizens and gen-
erally friendly with the city guards
and watch.

Wererat encounters will be with from
2to 5 wererats. They will be in human
form 90% of the time in day and 50%
of the time at night. They intelligently
set up, ambush, or react to intruders if
discovered.

Weretiger encounters will be with
from 1 to 2 weretigers. All day, and
90% of the night, weretigers will be in
human form. A weretiger is 90%
likely to be a temporary resident of
town on an errand, and likely to avoid
or ignore adventurers,
Werewolfencounters will be with from 2
to S werewolves. All day, and 50% of the
night, they will be in human form. The
werewolves are 80% likely to be seeking
prey, although there is a 20% chance
they are on a special errand and will
avoid encounters.

The aerial servant is a semi-intelligent form of an air elemental
native to the elemental plane of air, the ethereal plane, and the as-
tral plane. An encounter with an aerial servant in the prime mate-
rial plane is usually the result of a conjuration by a cleric.

When encountered in the material plane, aerial servants nor-
mally are invisible. They are dimly visible in their native planes,
resembling legless humanoids made of sparkling blue smoke.
They have empty eye sockets, a thin slash for a mouth, and two
long arms with large hands and four thick fingers.

Combat: An aerial servant generally avoids combat in its native
planes. However, if attacked or threatened, it responds by at-
tempting to grab and strangle its opponent. The aerial servant's
first successful roll to hit means it has grabbed its victim; in each
successive round that it holds its victim, the aerial servant, if it de-
sires, automatically inflicts 8-32 hp of damage. An aerial servant
is very strong and can easily carry weights in excess of 10,000
gold pieces. A character must have a Strength of 18 to have any
chance of breaking free. For each percentage point score the char-
acter has, there is a like chance to break free of the aerial servant's
grasp; for instance, a character with an 18/50% Strength has a
50% chance of breaking free, while a character with a 00% or 19
automatically breaks free. (If the grasped creature has no
Strength rating, roll the appropriate number of the creature's Hit
Dice and 16 HD for the aerial servant; if the creature's total is
higher, it breaks free.)

An aerial servant in the command of a cleric will not fight for
him, but will complete any other assigned duty, usually finding
and returning an object or victim. If assigned to return a victim,
the aerial servant grabs the victim as described above. Addition-
ally, those attacked by an aerial servant in the material plane have
a -5 surprise modifier. If the summoning cleric does not protect
himself by casting protection from evil or by standing inside a
protective symbol, the aerial servant will attempt to crush and
kill him. If the aerial servant is prevented from completing its as-
signed mission, it becomes insane, returns to the cleric, and at-
tempts to kill him.

Habitat/Society: Aerial servants are not organized into fami-
lies, communities, or any other social units. They do not collect
treasure. Aerial servants pass the time by soaring on the elemen-
tal, astral, and ethereal winds, exploring the infinite mysteries of

 

 

 

 

their native planes. As they have no permanent lairs, aerial ser-
vants have a virtually limitless range and are not tied to any spe-
cific territory. They are particularly drawn to areas of extreme
weather, such as the ether cyclones of the ethereal plane (sinuous,
serpentine columns of force), the psychic wind storms of the as-
tral plane (hurricane-like areas of darkness), and the aerial mael-
stroms of the plane of elemental air (doughnut-shaped
tornadoes). Generally, aerial servants are able to avoid the dan-
gers of these phenomena. However, if a careless aerial servant is
caught up in one of these storms, there is a 5% chance it will be
blown in two, with each half becoming a separate aerial servant.
This is the only way aerial servants reproduce, an extremely pain-
ful process the aerial servants strive to avoid.

Aerial servants will not voluntarily leave their home plane and
have no interest in material plane affairs. They resent being sum-
moned by clerics to the prime material plane and will attempt to
complete their missions as soon as possible in order to return home.

Ecology: Aerial servants do not consume food for nourishment.
Instead, they are refreshed and energized by being buffeted in the
planar winds. Long periods of calm weather cause aerial servants
to grow listless and weak. If an aerial servant is not exposed to a
planar wind in excess of 30 miles per hour for 30 consecutive
days, it risks suffering damage; beginning on day 31, it has a 10%
chance per day of losing 1d8 hp of damage. Aerial servants re-
cover lost hit points at the rate of 1d8 per hour of being buffeted
by planar winds in excess of 30 miles per hour. They are unaf-
fected by winds of the prime material plane.

Aerial servants have no natural enemies. They rarely associate
with other creatures, although they do have an affinity for air ele-
mentals, occasionally tagging along after them. However, air ele-
mentals avoid and discourage contact with aerial servants,
considering them an inferior species.

Herd animals live in all climates and terrain, from freezing tundra
(bactrian camel) to temperate hills (wild cattle) to tropical plains
(antelope). Though normally passive, herd animals can be dan-
gerous when angered or frightened.

Herd animals are four-legged hoofed mammals covered with
hair—thick fur for buffalo, curly wool for sheep, and short,
coarse hair for camels, antelope, and sheep. Male cattle, buffalo,
antelope, and sheep have sharp horns. A camel's humps (one hum
for dromedaries, two for bactrian) enable it to go without food or
water for up to two weeks.

Combat: Most herd animals attack by biting. Buffalo defend
themselves with their horns, usually attacking if approached too
closely (6' or less); if charging from a distance of at least 40’, a
buffalo does 3-18 hp of impaling damage plus 1-4 hp of trampling

damage. Nasty-tempered camels have a 50% chance of spitting at
persons attempting to ride them or use them for pack animals; the
victim of a spit attack has a 25% chance of being blinded for 1-3
rounds. Cattle, antelope, and sheep generally flee from danger,
but will attack if cornered or threatened. A male antelope or
sheep defending his herd will charge, inflicting 1-4 hp of butting
damage if charging from at least 40’. Male cattle are 75% likely to
attack if intruders approach before the herd has a chance to es-
cape.

if frightened by intruders, there is a 25% that the entire herd
will stampede. If a herd stampedes, roll 2d4 for each creature in
the path of the stampede who does not take cover (such as by hid-
ing in a tree or behind a rock pile or wall). This is the number of
herd animals trampling the exposed creature. Trampling causes
either 1-4 hp of damage (camel, cattle, antelope, and sheep) or 1-6
hp of damage (buffalo) per herd animal trampling.

Habitat/Society: Herd animals graze on open terrain, migrating
to a new territory when the food supply of the old has been de-
pleted. Herd size varies from a family of four buffalo to a com-
mercial flock of 1,000 sheep. The largest and oldest male usually
serves as the leader, directing the movement his herd and watch-
ing for predators. Herd animals do not collect treasure.

Ecology: Herd animals eat grass, grains, and shrubbery. They
are the favored prey of carnivores, including lions, tigers, and
dragons. Man often domesticates herd animals for their meat,
milk, fur (blankets and clothing), and skin (shoes and tents).
Dried droppings of herd animals can be burned for fuel.

Bats are common animals in many parts of the world. While ordi-
nary bats are annoying but harmless, larger varieties are deadly.

With almost 2,000 different species of bats, one can find wing-
spans from less than two inches across to 15 feet and more. The
small body of the ordinary bat resembles a mouse, while the
wings are formed from extra skin stretched across its forelimbs.
The larger bats are scaled up but otherwise similar in appearance.

Despite the common belief that bats are blind, nearly all
known species have rather good eyesight. In the dark, however,
they do not rely on their visual acuity, but navigate instead by
echo-location. Thus, by emitting a high-pitched squeal and listen-
ing for it to bounce back to them, they detect their surroundings
by a natural form of sonar.

Combat: Ordinary bats will attack only if cornered and left
with no other option. If startled, bats tend to become frightened
and confused. This causes them to begin swarming around and
often fly into things. Thus, the typical bat swarm ends up putting
out torches, confusing spell casting, and otherwise getting in the
way. Under ideal flying conditions, a bat’s Armor Class rating
rises from 8 to 4.

Habitat/Society: While bats can be found almost anywhere,
they prefer warmer climes. Some species hibernate during the
cold season and a few are known to migrate. Bats live in caves or
dark buildings, hanging by their feet during the day, and leaving
at dusk to feed during the night. In certain large caverns there
may be thousands of bats.

Ecology: Most bats are fruit- or insect-eaters, though some in-
clude small animals or fish in their diets. The rare vampire bat
travels at night to drink the warm blood of living creatures, but
its victims are never humans or demihumans, and care must be
taken not to confuse the vampire bat with the true vampire in this
regard.

Giant Bat

These creatures, which are giant versions of the carnivorous vari-
ety of the ordinary bat, have bodies 3’ long and a wingspan of 5'-
6’. They dwell in dark caverns, usually underground, and depend
on their sonar in flight to compensate for their poor eyesight.
Only 10% of giant bats are of the more powerful 1 hit die variety.
Giant bats are so highly maneuverable in flight that anyone *
with a dexterity of less than 13 who fires a missile at a flying giant
bat suffers a —3 penalty to their attack roll. The creature must
land (usually on its victim) to attack with its bite. The typical ex-
ample of this species inflicts 1-2 points of damage with its teeth
while the larger does 1-4 points of damage. Anyone bitten by a gi-
et bat has a 1% chance per point of damage done of contracting
rabies.

Mobat

Mobats prefer warm-blooded prey which they bite to death with
their fangs. They have a dim and evil intelligence which gives
them a desire for shiny objects. Because the typical mobat has a
wingspan of 12-16 feet they must have a large area in which to
take off.

Because mobats’ flight is so rapid and silent, their victims suffer
a —3 on their surprise rolls. They can also give a piercing screech
which will cause such pain to prey that the victims seek to cover
their ears rather than fight unless a saving throw versus paralysis
is successful. This screech is always used if their prey resists and is
effective in a 20-foot radius about the mobat. Note that mobile
mobats have a normal Armor Class of 2. Under crowded flying
conditions, however, their Armor Class suffers and is raised to 7.
When not in flight, mobats are Armor Class 10.

Arather common omnivorous mammal, bears tend to avoid humans unless
_ provoked. Exceptions to this rule can be a most unfortunate occurrence.

Bears are, in general, large and powerful animals which are found
throughout the world’s temperate and cooler climates. With dense fur
protecting them from the elements and powerful claws protecting them
from other animals, bears are the true rulers of the animal kingdom in the
areas where they live.

The so-called black bear actually ranges in color from black to light brown.
It is smaller than the brown bear and the most widespread species by far.

Combat: Although black bears are usually not aggressive, they are able
fighters when pressed. If a black bear scores a paw hit with an 18 or better
it also hugs for 2-8 (2d4) points of additional damage.

Habitat/Society: All bears have excellent senses of hearing and smell but
rather poor eyesight. The size shown is an average for the variety and
larger individuals will, of course, be correspondingly more powerful.

One common misconception people hold about bears is that they hiber-
nate during the winter. In fact, they sleep most of the time, but their me-
tabolism does not slow down, and they often wake up and leave their lairs
during warm spells.

Bears live in small family groups. Female bears are very protective of
their young, and more than one individual has been badly injured when
taunting or playing with seemingly harmless bear cubs.

Ecology: All of these ursoids are omnivorous, although the gigantic
cave bear tends towards a diet of meat.

Bears are fairly intelligent animals that can be trained to perform in a
variety of ways, particularly if captured as cubs. Bears can thus be found
dancing in circuses or accompanying “mountain men” in the wilderness.

Brown Bear

The brown bear, of which the infamous grizzly is the most well known va-
riety, is a bear of very aggressive disposition. Brown bears are more car-
nivorous than their smaller cousins, the black bears. The grizzly in
particular will often bring down large game such as deer and elk.

Brown bears are aggressive hunters. If a brown bear scores a paw hit with
a roll of 18 or better it will also hug for 2-12 (2d6) points of additional dam-
age. Brown bears will continue to fight for 1-4 melee rounds after reaching 0
to -8 hit points. At -9 or fewer hit points, they are killed immediately.

Cave Bear

Cave bears are quite aggressive, willing to attack well-armed parties with-
out provocation. If a cave bear scores a paw hit with an 18 or better it also
hugs for 2-16 (2d8) points of additional damage. Cave bears will continue
to fight for 1-4 melee rounds after reaching 0 to -8 hit points. At -9 or
fewer hit points, they are killed immediately.

Polar Bear

These powerful swimmers feed mostly on marine animals. A paw hit of 18
or better indicates a “hug”, which inflicts 3-18 (3d6) points of additional
damage. These aggressive animals will fight for 2-5 rounds after being
brought to 0 to -12 hit points, but beyond that they will die instantly.

The behir is a snake-like reptilian monster whose dozen legs allow
it to move with considerable speed and climb at fully half its nor-
mal movement rate. It can fold its limbs close to its long, narrow
body and slither in snake-fashion if it desires. The head looks
more crocodilian than snake-like, but has no difficulty in opening
its mouth wide enough to swallow prey whole, the way a snake
does.

Behir have band-like scales of great hardness. Their color
ranges from ultramarine to deep blue with bands of gray-brown.
The belly is pale blue. The two large horns curving back over the
head look dangerous enough but are actually used for preening
the creature's scales and not for fighting.

Combat: A behir will attack its prey by first biting and then
looping its body around the victim and squeezing. If the latter at-
tack succeeds, the victim is subject to six talon attacks next
round.

A behir can discharge a 20-foot long stroke of electrical energy
once every 10 rounds. This lightning bolt will cause 24 points of
damage unless a saving throw versus breath weapon is made. In
the latter case, the target takes only half damage.

On a natural attack roll of 20 the behir swallows man-sized
prey whole. Any creature swallowed will lose '/s of its starting hit
points each round until it dies at the end of the sixth round. The
behir will digest its meal in 12 turns, and at that time the victim is
totally gone and cannot be raised from the dead. Note, however,
that a creature swallowed can try to cut its way out of the behir’s
stomach. The inner armor class of the behir is 7, but each round
the creature is in the behir it subtracts 1 from the damage each of
its attacks does. This subtraction is cumulative, so on the second
melee round there is a -2, on the third a -3, and so on.

Habitat/Society: Behir are solitary creatures, meeting others of
their kind only to mate and hatch a clutch of 1-4 eggs. The female
guards these eggs for eight months while the male hunts for the
pair. When the young hatch, they are immediately turned out of
the nest to fend for themselves, and the adults separate.

Newly hatched behir are about two feet long. Behir grow at a
rate of eight feet per year until fully mature. Interestingly enough,
newly hatched behir do not have all of their legs, having instead
only six or eight. Additional pairs of legs grow slowly over time un-
til the creature has its full complement when it reaches adulthood.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Behir range over a territory of about 400 square miles, often
living high up a cliff face in a cave.

Behir are never friendly with dragonkind, and will never be
found coexisting in the same geographical area with any type of
dragon. If a dragon should enter a behir's territory, the behir will
do everything it can to drive the dragon out. If the behir fails in
this task, it will move off to find a new home. A behir will never
knowingly enter the territory of a dragon.

Ecology: Behir are useful to mages, priests, and alchemists for a
number of concoctions. The horns of a behir can be used to brew
the ink necessary to inscribe a lightning bolt scroll, and the sharp
talons can likewise be used by a cleric to make the ink for a neu-
tralize poison scroll. The heart of the behir is one of the more
common ingredients for ink for a protection from poison scroll.

As behir sometimes swallow prey whole, there is a 10% chance
that there will be some small items of value inside the monster.
More often than not (60%) these will be gems (10 x Q). Other-
wise, there is a 30% chance that there will be from 1-8 pieces of
jewelry and a 10% chance that a single small magical object of an
indegistible nature may be found. Such objects are never found in
a behir's lair, because the creature expels this waste and buries it
elsewhere.

The scales are valued for their hardness and color, and are
worth up to 500 gp to an armorer who can use them to fashion a
highly ornate set of scale mail armor.

The beholder (also known as the eye tyrant or sphere of many eyes) is
most frequently found underground, although it will lair in desolate
wildernesses from time to time.

The globular body of this monster is supported by levitation, al-
lowing it to float slowly about as it wills. Atop the sphere are 10 eye-
stalks, while in its central area are a great eleventh eye and a large
mouth filled with pointed teeth.

Beholders can speak their own language and will often know
tongues of other lawful evil creatures.

Combat: The body is protected by a hard chitinous covering with
an Armor Class of 0. The creature's eyestalks and eyes are also pro-
tected, although less well, having armor classes of 2 and 7 respec-
tively.

The various eyes of a beholder each have a different function. Typ-
ically only the central eye, plus 1-4 of those on stalks, are able to func-
tion considering that an attack usually comes from an arc 90 degrees
before the monster. If attacks come from 180 degrees double the num-
ber of eyestalks able to function, and for 270 degrees or 360 degrees
triple or quadruple the number. Attacks from above enable all 10 eye-
stalks to function, but the central eye cannot. Functions of the eyes
are:

Charm person
Charm monster
Sleep
Telekinese 250 pound weight
Flesh to stone ray (30 yard range)
Disintegrate ray (20 yard range)
Fear (as a wand)

Central eye Anti-magic ray (140 yard range)

The anti-magic ray covers a 90° arc. All magic within the area
ceases to function as long as it remains in the area. Spells cast from
within the area or passing through it automatically fail.

Because of its particular nature the beholder is able to withstand the
loss of its eyestalks, each taking from 8 to 12 hit points before being
lost. These members are not computed as part of its hit point damage
potential, and lost eyestalks will eventually grow back (one week per
lost member). The body of the monster can withstand two-thirds of
its total damage potential, while the great central eye can withstand
one-third this total. Thus, a beholder with 45 hit points can withstand
30 hit points of damage to its body before being killed and the elev-
enth eye could withstand 15 points before ceasing to function. The
body of a beholder represents 75% of potential hit area, the central
eye and the eyestalks 10% each, and the 10 small eyes 5%.

 

Habitat/Society: The beholder is hateful, aggressive, and avari-
cious. It will usually attack immediately. If confronted by a particu-
larly powerful party there is a50% chance it will listen to negotiations
(either being bribed not to attack or paying a ransom to not be at-
tacked, depending on the strength of the opposing party).

Ecology: An eye froma stalk is an important ingredient in some po-
tions of levitation, and as such can be sold to mages or alchemists for
as much as 50 gp each.

Eye of the Deep

The evil eye of the deep dwells only at great depths, floating slowly
about, and stalking prey.

They have two crab-like pincers which inflict 2-8 (2d4) points of
damage each and a wide mouth full of sharp teeth that does 1-6 points
of damage.

Its primary weapons, however, are its eyes. The creature's large
central eye emits a cone of blinding light 5’ wide at its start, 30' long,
and 20’ wide at its base. Those in this cone must save versus poison or
be stunned for 2-8 (2d4) rounds.

The eye of the deep also has two smaller eyes on long stalks with
which it is able to create an illusion. Acting independently, the small
eyes are able to cast hold person and hold monster spells respectively.

This monster has an Armor Class of 5 everywhere, including its
eyes and eye stalks. If its eyestalks are severed they will grow back in
about a week.

Boars, a type of wild swine, are the ancestors of our domesticated
hogs. Boars are, of course, more aggressive than the barnyard an-
imal, and an unexpected encounter with a family of these crea-
tures or one large individual can be fatal.

Boars look much like hogs, but have slightly shorter snouts,
coarser and darker hair, and straighter tails. Some varieties have
small tusks at each side of the face.

Combat: Boars are dangerous foes when angered. They have a
vicious bite and those with tusks can employ them to rip at un-
protected flesh with great effectiveness.

The boar will fight for 2-5 (1d4 +1) melee rounds after reaching
0 to -6 hit points but dies immediately at -7 or fewer hit points.

Habitat/Society Boars live in family units as a rule. If more
than one wild boar is encountered the others will be sows (3 hit
dice, 2-8 (2d4) hit points damage/attack) or sounders, with a 1:4
(sows:sounders) ratio. Thus if 12 are encountered there will be 1
boar, 3 sows, and 8 young.

Ecology: Boars are true omnivores who will eat virtually any-
thing. While eating a variety of foods is generally considered
healthy, in the case of the wild boar this can lead to problems. A
small roundworm, Trichinella spiralis, is a parasite that can in-
habit a boar's body. This creates a problem when a human eats
the boar without cooking it properly, as trichinosis, the disease
caused by this parasite, is easily transmissible to humans. Once
infected with the parasite, the host suffers fever, sweating, and
sore muscles until a cure disease spell is cast.

Whether domesticated or not, the boar provides a number of
products useful to man. All three varieties listed here are edible. Boar
lard can be used interchangeably with domesticated swine lard.
Leather from the wild species can be used for gloves and comfortable
leather armor. The stiff bristles can be used for brushes.

Giant Boar

This prehistoric forerunner of the wild boar is also very aggres-
sive. If 3 or more are encountered there is only a 25% chance that
there will be young (2-6 hit dice, 1-4/2-5 (1d4 +1)/2-7 (1d6 +1)/
2-8 (2d4)/3-12 (3d4) points of damage/attack) numbering from 1-
4 of the total herd. The boars and sows fight equally, and either
will fight for 1-4 melee rounds after reaching 0 to -10 hit points
but die immediately upon reaching -11 or fewer hit points.

Warthog

These tropical beasts are aggressive only if their territory is
threatened or if cornered. They make two slashing attacks with
their large tusks. Male and female fight equally. If more than 2 are
encountered the balance will be young (1-2 hit dice, 1-3/2-5
(1d4 +1) points of damage/attack). The warthog will continue to
fight for 1-2 melee rounds after reaching 0 to -5 hit points but at -6
or fewer points it dies immediately.

This small worm, only one inch long, is greatly feared by mages
because it is attracted to paper in all forms. It can smell scrolls,
maps, arcane tomes, and spell books at a distance of 60 feet.

Normally a dull gray color, a bookworm’s chameleon-like abil-
ities enable it to instinctively blend into any background. Its high
Armor Class is due to its speed and agility. If found motionless the
bookworm is AC 9.

Combat: The bookworm initially imposes a -7 on the surprise
rolls of adventurers because of its color-changing ability. If the
victim can see invisible things, the bookworm’s modifier is re-
duced to -4. Note that these chances apply even to creatures nor-
mally hard to surprise (like rangers and monks), because of its
small size, speed (very great in proportion to its size), and inof-
fensive nature. If the bookworm does initially gain surprise, it
may then be discovered (25%) on the outside of a victim's leg or
pack. Otherwise, it will remain unnoticed unless the victim bear-
ing paper hears the creature's noisy munching (base 50% chance
per round). A feeding bookworm is motionless until attacked.
After any attack it will flee (if possible) by first jumping 10 feet
and then crawling back to its lair at top speed.

A bookworm can burrow through dead wood or leather at a
rate of 3 inches per round and through a leather scroll case or
pack in one segment but cannot digest living matter of any type.
It will destroy spell books and scrolls at the rate of one spell level
per round (i.e., five rounds for a scroll of a single Sth-level spell).

Habitat/Society: A bookworm lair is always a library or store-
room of some kind, whether in use or long-forgotten. When a
bookworm is encountered, there may be undamaged paper items
remaining (30% chance). In such cases, the surviving objects will
be as follows: a map (60%), scroll (30%), or an arcane work of
mage level 1-8 (10%). If spell books are indicated, they should be
appropriate for the level of the characters finding them but will be
0-90% (1d10-1) destroyed by the worms.

A breeding pair of bookworms lays 80 eggs; about half of these
hatch a month later. The larvae have less than an hour to find pa-
per nourishment, or they die. When first hatched, the larvae are
pure white, but they develop their dull gray color from ingesting
the ink on the paper that makes up their diet. Unfortunately, the
buildup of ink in their systems eventually kills them. The average
lifespan of a bookworm is two or three years. A bookworm
breeds only once in its lifetime, after which it dies.

   

 

 

 

 

When an adventurer is careless enough to encounter a new
brood of bookworm larvae, he can inflict incredible damage by
carrying them unwittingly with him to other places. A handful of
larvae hiding in a backpack traveling down a city street can find
new homes readily, destroying the libraries of sages, temples,
magic-users, and governments in the process.

Ecology: A bookworm will always be attracted to the largest
volume of paper in an area.

Because of its unusual diet, the bookworm is a valuable ingre-
dient in various alchemical preparations. Chief among these is the
ink used to inscribe protection from magic scrolls. Because it is
the residual ink in the bookworm’s body that is the “active ingre-
dient” in this case, the darker the bookworm, the better it is for
this purpose.

The bookworm itself can be a useful tool under the right cir-
cumstances. Releasing a bookworm in a mage’s tower could exact
revenge of a most lasting sort. There are a few cases on record,
also, of criminals gaining release from prison when important
documents turned up missing during their trials. Such use of a
bookworm is both difficult and dangerous: difficult because it is
hard to keep a bookworm alive under captivity, and dangerous
because the bookworm, once released, may not leave its owner.
Releasing a bookworm at an enemy's hideout and then having it
follow you home is an unpleasant experience at best.

Brownies are small, benign humanoids who may be very dis-
tantly related to halflings. Peaceful and friendly, brownies fre-
quent pastoral areas, where they live by foraging and gleaning.

Brownies stand no more than 2’ tall and are exceedingly nim-
ble. They resemble small elves with brown hair and bright blue
eyes. Brownies wear bright colored garments made from wool or
linen with gold ornamentation. Brownies normally carry leather
pouches containing tools for the repair of leather, wood and
metal.

Brownies speak their own language in addition to the common
tongue of men and those of elves, pixies, sprites, and halflings.

Combat: Brownies prefer not to engage in combat, and will
only do so if threatened. Angry brownies will rarely meet their
foes in hand to hand combat, relying instead on their magical
abilities.

Since their senses are unusually keen it is impossible to surprise
brownies. They are superb at blending into their surroundings
quickly and can thus become all but invisible when they choose to
do so. This, combined with their great agility, gives them an Ar-
mor Class of 3.

Brownies will use their magical spells to harass, confuse, or
drive away their enemies. They can use the following spells once
per day: protection from evil, ventriloquism, dancing lights,
continual light, mirror image (3 images), confusion, and dimen-
sion door.

If cornered and unable to employ their spells, brownies will
fight with their short swords.

Habitat/Society: Brownies dwell in rural areas, often living
close to or on farms as they are fascinated by farm life. Brownies
make their homes in small burrows or abandoned buildings.

Although they are solitary creatures they will often meet to dis-
cuss local affairs. They are very particular about the communities
they live in, and will set up their homes only in orderly, lawful
good areas.

Brownies live by harvesting wild fruits and gleaning grain from
a farmer's field. Being honest to the core, a brownie will always
perform some service in exchange for what is taken. A brownie
might milk a farmer's cows and take a small quantity of milk for
himself.

Some brownies will go so far as to become house brownies. He
will observe the families in a given area, and if one meets his high

 

  
 

 

 

 

moral standards, the brownie will secretly enter the household.
At night, while the residents are asleep, the brownie will perform
a variety of helpful tasks. He will spin, sweep, bake bread, repair
farm implements, keep foxes out of the hen house, mend clothes,
and so forth. If a thief creeps into the house silently, the brownie is
sure to make enough noise to awaken the residents. Watchdogs
and domestic animals all consider brownies friendly and will
never attack or bark at them.

All brownies ask in exchange for their labor is a little milk,
some bread, and an occasional bit of fruit. Etiquette demands, in
fact, that other than the giving of such provisions, no notice be
taken of the brownie. If the residents boast about the presence of
the brownie, he will vanish.

Brownies are not greedy, but they do have small hoards of
coins and gems which they have taken from evil monsters or re-
ceived as gifts from grateful humans. A brownie will sometimes
leave his treasure in a location where a good person in need is
bound to find it.

Strangers and outsiders will be constantly watched by the
brownies of the community until their motives are ascertained. If
the brownies decide that the stranger is harmless, he will be left in
peace. If not, the brownies will unite and drive the intruder out.

Brownies know every nook and cranny of the areas they live
in, and thus make excellent guides. If asked politely, there is a
50% chance that a brownie will agree to act as a guide for adven-
turers.

Ecology: Brownies are basically vegetarians, who live very
comfortably on the byproducts of agricultural life. They make ef-
ficient use of leftovers too small for humans to notice. When
brownies glean from fields, they do so after harvest, gathering
grains and fruits which might otherwise be wasted.

Bugbears are giant, hairy cousins of goblins who frequent the
same areas as their smaller relatives.

Bugbears are large and very muscular, standing 7’ tall. Their
hides range from light yellow to yellow brown and their thick
coarse hair varies in color from brown to brick red. Though
vaguely humanoid in appearance, bugbears seem to contain the
blood of some large carnivore. Their eyes recall those of some
savage bestial animal, being greenish white with red pupils, while
their ears are wedge shaped, rising from the top of their heads. A
bugbear’s mouth is full of long sharp fangs.

Bugbears have a nose much like that of a bear with the same
fine sense of smell. It is this feature which earned them their
name, despite the fact that they are not actually related to bears in
any way. Their tough leathery hide and long sharp nails also look
something like those of a bear, but are far more dexterous.

The typical bugbear’s sight and hearing are exceptional, and
they can move with amazing agility when the need arises. Bug-
bear eyesight extends somewhat into the infrared, giving them
infravision out to 60 feet.

The bugbear language is a foul sounding mixture of gestures,
grunts, and snarls which leads many to underestimate the intelli-
gence of these creatures. In addition, most bugbears can speak the
language of goblins and hobgoblins.

Combat: Whenever possible, bugbears prefer to ambush their
foes. They impose a -3 on others’ surprise rolls.

If a party looks dangerous, bugbear scouts will not hesitate to
fetch reinforcements. A bugbear attack will be tactically sound, if
not brilliant. They will hurl small weapons, such as maces, ham-
mers, and spears before closing with their foes. If they think they
are outnumbered or overmatched, bugbears will retreat, prefer-
ring to live to fight another day.

Habitat/Society: Bugbears prefer to live in caves and in under-
ground locations. A lair may consist of one large cavern or a
group of caverns. They are well-adapted to this life, since they
operate equally well in daylight and darkness.

Ifa lair is uncovered and 12 or more bugbears are encountered
they will have a leader. These individuals have between 22 and 25
hit points, an Armor Class of 4, and attack as 4 hit die monsters.

 

 

 

 

 

Their great strength gives them a +3 to all damage inflicted in
melee combat.

If 24 or more bugbears are encountered, they will have a chief
in addition to their leaders. Chiefs have between 28 and 30 hit
points, an Armor Class of 3, and attack as 4 hit die monsters.
Chiefs are so strong that they gain a +4 bonus to all damage
caused in melee. Each chief will also have a sub-chief who is iden-
tical to the leaders described above.

In a lair, half of the bugbears will be females and young who
will not fight except in a life or death situation. If they are forced
into combat, the females attack as hobgoblins and the young as
kobolds.

The species survives primarily by hunting. They have no com-
punctions about eating anything they can kill, including humans,
goblins, and any monsters smaller than themselves. They are also
fond of wine and strong ale, often drinking to excess.

Bugbears are territorial, and the size of the domains vary with
the size of the group and its location. It may be several square
miles in the wilderness, or a narrow, more restricted area in an
underground region.

Intruders are considered a valuable source of food and trea-
sure, and bugbears rarely negotiate. On occasion, they will par-
ley if they think they can gain something exceptional by it.
Bugbears sometimes take prisoners to use as slaves.

Extremely greedy, bugbears love glittery, shiny objects and
weapons. They are always on the lookout to increase their hoards
of coins, gems, and weapons through plunder and ambush.

Ecology: Bugbears have two main goals in life: survival and
treasure. They are superb carnivores, winnowing out the weak
and careless adventurer, monster and animal. Goblins are always
on their toes when bugbears are present, for the weak or stupid
quickly end up in the stewpot.

The carrion crawler is a scavenger of subterranean areas, feeding
primarily upon carrion. When such food becomes scarce, how-
ever, it will attack and kill living creatures.

The crawler looks like a cross between a giant green cutworm
and a cephalopod. Like so many other hybrid monsters, the car-
rion crawler may well be the result of genetic experimentation by
a mad, evil wizard.

The monster's head, which is covered with a tough hide that
gives it Armor Class 3, sprouts eight slender, writhing tentacles.
The body of the carrion crawler is not well protected and has an
armor class of only 7. The monster is accompanied by a rank,
fetid odor which often gives warning of its approach.

Combat: The carrion crawler can move along walls, ceilings
and passages very quickly, using its many clawed feet for trac-
tion.

When attacking, the monster lashes out with its 2' long tenta-
cles, each of which produces a sticky secretion that can paralyze
its victims for 2-12 turns. A save versus paralyzation is allowed to
escape these effects. They kill paralyzed creatures with their bite
which inflicts 1-2 points of damage. The monster will always at-
tack with all of its tentacles.

Carrion crawlers are non-intelligent, and will continue to at-
tack as long as any of their opponents are unparalyzed. Groups of
crawlers attacking together will not fight in unison, but will each
concentrate on paralyzing as many victims as they can. When
seeking out prey, they rely primarily on their keen senses of sight
and smell. Clever travelers have been known to fool an ap-
proaching carrion crawler with a sight and smell illusion, thus
gaining time to make good their escape.

Habitat/Society: Carrion crawlers are much-feared denizens of
the underground world. They live in lairs, venturing out in search
of carrion or food every few days. Some underground inhabit-
ants such as goblins and trolls will make use of carrion crawlers
by leaving the bodies of dead foes out in designated areas. This
keeps the creatures at a good distance from their own homes and
encourages them to “patrol” certain areas. Some orcs have been
known to chain live prisoners near the lairs of these fearsome
monsters.

Carrion crawlers will sometimes live with a mate or in a small
group numbering no more than 6. This does not mean that they
cooperate in hunting, but merely share the same space and com-

 

 

 

 

 

 

pete fiercely for the same food. If 2 crawlers have made a kill or
discovered carrion, they will often fight over the food, sometimes
killing one another in the process.

The carrion crawler mates once a year. Several days after mat-
ing, the female will go off in search of a large kill. When she has
found or killed an adequate food supply, she lays about 100 eggs
among the carrion. The grubs hatch one week later and begin
feeding.

Maternal care ceases once the eggs have been laid and it is not
uncommon for eggs to later be eaten by the female who laid them.
Females die a few weeks after laying their eggs, exhausted by the
effort. Males live only a short time longer, having mated with as
many females as possible. Grubs have been known to consume
one another in feeding frenzies, and are a favorite food of adult
carrion crawlers. Few of the grubs reach maturity, but those who
do have eaten voraciously and will achieve their full size in a sin-
gle year. When they reach maturity, the mating cycle begins
again,

These monsters exist on the most basic instinctual level, having
no more intelligence than earthworms or most insects. The car-
rion crawler is driven by two urges: food and reproduction. It has
absolutely no interest in the collection of treasure.

Ecology: The carrion crawler provides the same useful, if dis-
agreeable, function that jackals, vultures, and crows perform.
Like so many other predators carrion crawlers instinctively prey
on the weak, sick, and foolish. In the long run, this has a benefi-
cial effect on the prey, strengthening its gene pool. The carrion
crawler also works wonders in over crowded caverns, quickly
eliminating population problems among the weaker monsters.
Thus, the life cycle of the crawler is inextricably linked to those of
its prey—when the prey flourishes so does the crawler.

The catoblepas is a bizarre, loathsome creature that inhabits dis-
mal swamps and marshes. Its most terrifying features are its large
bloodshot eyes, from which emanate a deadly ray.

The body of the catoblepas is like that of a large, bloated buf-
falo, and its legs are stumpy, like those of a pygmy elephant or a
hippopotamus. Its long, snakey tail is swift and strong, and can
move with blinding speed. The head of the catoblepas is perched
upon a long, weak neck, and would be much like that of a wart-
hog except that the catoblepas is uglier.

Combat: In combat, the catoblepas relies on two forms of at-
tack.

First, it will use its strong, snaky tail to strike and stun its foes.
Anyone struck by the tail suffers 1-6 points of damage and has a
base 75% chance of being stunned for 1-10 melee rounds. The
base chance of being stunned is lowered by 5% for every level
above first, or for each additional hit die in the case of monsters
and animals.

Despite the danger of a tail strike, the catoblepas’ second mode
of attack is by far the more fearsome of the two. The gaze of the
catoblepas emanates a deathray, with a 60 yard range. Any crea-
ture meeting its gaze dies without a saving throw. If a party is sur-
prised by a catoblepas, there is a 1 in 6 chance that someone in the
group has met the creature's gaze. Those who close their eyes or
act with their eyes averted can still be affected by the deathray,
but a saving throw versus death magic is allowed.

Since the neck of the creature is very weak, it has only a 25%
chance of raising its head and using the deathray on subsequent
rounds. If the catoblepas and its target are both relatively still, this in-
creases by 15% per melee round. If the catoblepas is forced to follow
quick motions it has only a 10% chance of raising its head.

If more than one catoblepas is attacking, the monsters will co-
operate with one another, attempting to herd their targets into a
crossfire.

Habitat/Society: For the most part, the catoblepas is a meander-
ing creature that wanders about its swamp nibbling on marsh
grasses and the like. Once a month, usually under the light of the
full moon, the catoblepas seeks out meat to round out its diet. It is
at this time that the catoblepas is most likely to be encountered by
adventurers.

The lair of the catoblepas is usually some sort of sheltered place
where the ground is firm. More often than not it is surrounded by

    

 

 

 

 

a tall stand of reeds or other marsh plants. The creature has little
fear of being disturbed in its lair, since it is frequently the most
feared carnivore in the swamp.

The catoblepas mates for life and when more than one catoble-
pas is encountered they will be a mated pair. There is a 10%
chance that the couple will have a single offspring with them, An
immature catoblepas will have half the Hit Dice of an adult. It
takes almost nine years for the offspring to reach youthful matu-
rity and an adult female will bear but one child every 10 or 12
years. Both the male and the female will cooperate in raising the
offspring.

When the catoblepas ventures forth to hunt it eats fish, marsh
birds, eels, water rats, large amphibians, snakes, and other
swamp animals. The catoblepas usually stuns its prey with its tail
and then kills it with its gaze.

The catoblepas is an opportunistic predator when it hunts and
it is not above eating carrion. Since it is semi-intelligent, it will
treat parties of humans with respect, preferring to size them up
first. Asa rule, it will not attack unless it is hunting or feels that its
mate or offspring is threatened. Being long-lived (150 to 200 years
or so) and semi-intelligent, the catoblepas is capable of learning
from the mistakes of earlier encounters and hunts.

The catoblepas has no special interest in wealth, and the listed
treasure type is the result of victorious encounters with intruders.
It attaches no value to the coins, gems, and occasional magical
items strewn about the lair.

Ecology: The catoblepas has no natural enemies, since its gaze
provides it with more than adequate protection from even the
fiercest of predators.

The great cats are among the most efficient of all predators.

Cheetah

The cheetah is a medium-sized, lightly built cat. Its fur is sand
colored and it is covered with dark spots. The cheetah is unique
among cats because of its non-retractable claws.

A skilled hunter endowed with natural camouflage, victims of
a cheetah attack suffer a -3 on their surprise roll. They are famed
for their tremendous bursts of speed, and can run at triple speed
(45' per round) for three rounds. The cat must rest 3 turns before
sprinting again. Cheetahs can spring 10’ upward or 20’ forward.
If both forepaws hit during an attack the cheetah is able to rake
for 1-2 points of damage with each of its rear claws. If defending
their young, cheetahs receive a +2 on their attack and damage
rolls and will fight to the death.

Cheetahs inhabit warm plains and grasslands, often sharing
their range with lions. Their favorite prey are the antelope that in-
habit the plains, and they rarely attack men, Cheetahs are territo-
rial, but may live alone, in pairs and in groups. The female raises
a litter of 2-4 young alone. The young, who stay with their
mother for as long as 2 years, can be completely trained and do-
mesticated.

The fortunes of the cheetah rise and fall with those of its prey;
when the population of antelope and other game declines, so does
that of the cheetah.

Jaguar

The jaguar is a powerful cat with a deep chest and muscular
limbs. Its color ranges from light yellow to brownish red, and it is
covered with dark spots.

The jaguar will attack anything that it perceives as a threat. It
relies on stealth to close with its prey, often pouncing from above.
The jaguar can leap 30’ to attack. If both of its forepaws strike it
will rake with its two rear claws for 2-5 (1d4 +1) points of damage
each.

The jaguar inhabits jungles, spending a great deal of time in tree
tops. It climbs, swims, and stalks superbly. Jaguars are solitary and
territorial, meeting only to mate. If found in a lair, there is a 75%
Cats, Great

chance there will be 1-3 cubs. Cubs do not fight effectively.
Their strength and ferocity make jaguars one of the most feared
predators of the jungle.

Leopard:

The leopard is a graceful cat with a long body and relatively short
legs. Its color varies from buff to tawny, and its spots are rosette
shaped.

Leopards prefer to leap on their prey, imposing a -3 on the sur-
prise rolls of their victims. Leopards can spring upward 20’ or
ahead 25’. If they strike successfully with both forepaws, they
rake with their rear claws for 1-4 points each.

Leopards are solitary, inhabiting warm deserts, forest, plains,
and mountains. They hunt both day and night preying on ani-
mals up to the size of large antelopes. They swim and climb well,
and will often sit in treetops sunning themselves. Leopards will
also drag their prey to safety in the treetops to devour in peace.
The female bears 1-3 young, and cares for them for up to two
years. If found in the lair, there is a 25% chance that there will be
cubs there. The young have no effective attack.

A skilled predator, the leopard is often threatened by human
incursions. In areas where it is hunted, it is nocturnal.

Lion:

Among the largest and most powerful of the great cats, lions have
yellow or golden brown fur. The males are distinguished by their
flowing manes.

Both male and female lions are fierce fighters. Lions hunt in
prides, with females doing most of the actual hunting. Since their
senses are so keen, lions can only be surprised on a1. All lions can
leap as far as 30’. Males have an Armor Class of 5 in their fore-
quarters and 6 in their hindquarters while females are Armor
Class 6 in all areas. If a lion hits with both forepaws, it can rake
with its rear claws doing 2-7 points damage each.

Lions prefer warmer climates, thriving in deserts, jungles,
grasslands, and swamps. They live and hunt in prides, and are ex-
tremely territorial. A pride usually consists of 1-3 males and 1-10
females. Lions frequently kill animals the size of zebras or gi-
raffes. Lionesses will cooperate when hunting, driving their prey
into an ambush. They have been known to attack domestic live-
stock, but will almost never attack men. A lair will contain from
1-10 cubs which are 30%-60% grown. Cubs are unable to fight.
Lions are poor climbers and dislike swimming.

Lions flourish only when the supply of game is adequate. Their
size and strength have made them a favorite target of human
hunters.

Mountain Lion:

Nota true lion, this brownish cat is lankier than its large cousins.
Except for their size, males and females are difficult to tell apart.

The mountain lion is more cautious and less aggressive than its
larger relatives. They can spring upward 15’ or ahead 20’ to at-
tack or retreat. If they score hits with both of their forepaws, they
will rake with their back ones for 1-4 points of damage each. It
will not attack men unless threatened.

Mountain lions range in warm and temperate mountains, for-
ests, swamps, and plains. They are solitary, with males and fe-
males each maintaining separate territories. Their favorite prey
are deer. The female rears 2-4 cubs alone, which remain with her
for 1-2 years.

The mountain lion is flexible and elusive. It is adept at surviv-
ing on the fringes of human civilization.

Spotted Lion:

Spotted lions are large, fierce, dappled versions of the lion. They
are generally found in the plains of the Pleistocene epoch, and
rarely occur elsewhere.

Giant Lynx:

The giant lynx is distinguished by its tufted ears and cheeks, short
bobbed tail, and dappled coloring. It has a compact muscular
body, with heavy legs and unusually large paws.

The giant lynx is the most intelligent of the great cats and uses
its wits in combat. When hiding, a giant lynx will avoid detection
90% of the time. The lynx can leap up to 15’ and imposes a -6 on
the surprise rolls of its prey. It has a 75% chance of detecting
traps. If a giant lynx strikes with both forepaws, it attempts a rear
claw rake, causing 1-3 points of damage per claw. The giant lynx
almost never attacks men.

The giant lynx prefers cold coniferous and scrub forests. They
can communicate in their own language with others of its kind,
which greatly increases its chances of survival. The nocturnal
lynx stalks or ambushes its prey, catching rodents, young deer,
grouse, and other small game. The cubs remain with their mother
for 6 months.

The giant lynx has all the advantages of the great cats plus the
added bonus of a high intelligence which makes it even more
adaptable.

Tiger:

The tiger is the largest and most feared of the great cats. Tigers
have reddish-orange fur and dark vertical stripes.

A tiger is a redoubtable foe in battle and is surprised only ona
1. They are experts in stalking and often hunt in pairs or groups.
They can leap 10' upward, and spring forward 30’ to 50’ to at-
tack. If they strike successfully with both forepaws, their rear
claws rake for 2-8 (2d4) points of damage per claw.

This species ranges from the subarctic to the tropics, generally
inhabiting wooded or covered terrain. Tigers are nocturnal, soli-
tary, graceful climbers and swimmers who are capable of sus-
tained high speed. These animals rarely fight among themselves,
but will protect their territories ferociously. They are also the
most unpredictable and dangerous of the great cats, not hesitat-
ing to attack men. Their favorite prey includes cattle, wild pigs
and deer. Females raise their 1-3 cubs alone. The cubs remain with
their mother for several years. If encountered in the lair, there is a
25% chance that the cubs will be present.

Feared by men, tigers are hunted aggressively, and are threat-
ened by the destruction of forests. In the untamed wilderness,
however, the tiger occupies the top predatory niche.

Smilodon:

Although not truly a member of the cat family, the so-called
sabre-toothed tiger is similar to them in many ways. Smilodons
are known for their 6” long fangs which are capable of inflicting
terrible wounds. Their powerful jaws and large teeth give them a
+2 on their attack rolls. They are similar to normal tigers but are
found only during the Pleistocene epoch.

XP VALUE: 175

The cave fisher is a large insectoid that has adapted to life below
ground. It combines many of the characteristics of a spider and a
lobster.

The cave fisher has a hard, chitinous shell of overlapping plates
and eight legs. The 6 rear legs are used for movement and traction
on stony walls and corridors, Because of these limbs, the fisher
has no difficulty in moving up and down vertical walls. The front
pair of legs are equipped with powerful pincers, which are used
for killing and dismembering prey. The most unusual feature of
the cave fisher is its long snout, which can fire a strong, adhesive
filament. The monster can also use its adhesive to anchor itself in
place on walls and ledges.

Combat: The cave fisher has two ways of hunting. Its preferred
method is to string its long filament in the vicinity of its lair. The
filaments are thin and strong, making them exceedingly difficult
to detect or cut. There is only a 20% chance of noticing the strand
at 10’, and no chance at all of seeing them at a greater distance. A
detect snares and pits spell will reveal a strand. The filament is
coated with an adhesive which can only be dissolved by liquids
with a high alcohol content (such as the cave fisher’s blood). The
filaments can only be cut by +1 or better edged weapons.

The fisher’s favorite food are small, flying creatures like bats.
Ever opportunistic, they are constantly trying to vary their diet
by trapping a careless adventurer, foolish goblin, or orc (pro-
vided that they think that they can get away with it). If more than
one fisher inhabits a lair, they will frequently pool their resources
to catch larger prey. Once the victim is trapped in the filament,
the cave fisher draws its prey in, reeling its filament in like a fish-
ing line.

Should a tempting target escape the monster's neatly laid traps,
the cave fisher will try another mode of attack. It will spend one
round drawing its filament in and then shoot it at the prey, strik-
ing as a 6 Hit Die monster. It will try to snare its prey in this man-
ner so long as it remains within the fisher’s established territory. If
the prey is hit by the filament, the monster can pull a weight of up
to 400 pounds at a movement rate of 15’ per round. In the event
that a “tug of war” breaks out, the fisher has a strength of 18/00
with its strand.

Habitat/Society: Cave fishers prefer living on ledges and caves
located above well-traveled paths, sharing their lairs with others
of their kind. No more than four cave fishers will be found in one

   

 

 

 

 

lair. Their filaments are always strung before their lair, and they
attempt to kill anything they trap, often storing food for future
use.

Their territories are very small, and never larger than about
300 feet to either side of the lair. Anything man-sized or smaller is
considered fair game by the cave fisher and halflings are thought
to be tasty treats. A single cave fisher would never attack a large,
well armed party for the sake of a single meal. Still, they are cun-
ning, anda group of the monsters might reel in their filaments and
attempt an ambush if they thought they could get away with it. If
hunting in one area becomes scarce, the cave fisher will simply
find a new area to hunt, where the small game is more plentiful
and careless.

Like all predators, the cave fisher is interested in survival. This
means a steady supply of food and a mate. Females lay eggs in the
vicinity of the lair, which they protect from predators. The young,
scatter when the eggs hatch, seeking lairs of their own.

Although the cave fisher does not collect treasure, its lair is of-
ten strewn with the possessions of its former victims.

Ecology: The cave fisher preys primarily on small flying game,
and in the subterranean world this frequently means a diet of
bats. It is not the top predator in its ecological niche, and has
learned caution in dealing with other monsters. The cave fisher is
sufficiently intelligent to know the dangers of preying on large,
well-organized groups, who might grow tired of its depredations
and hunt it to extinction. The monster instinctively picks the easi-
est route for survival, and relies on stealth and cunning to trap its
prey and avoid being eaten itself.

The filaments of the cave fisher are highly prized by many
thieves’ guilds, for they can be made into thin and very strong
rope which is nearly invisible. The filaments are wound onto reels
and then specially treated to dilute the adhesive. The resulting
strands are made into ropes, while the diluted adhesive is turned
into a special solution, which when applied to gloves and boots,
greatly increases traction for climbing.

Centaurs are woodland beings who shun the company of men.
They dwell in remote, secluded glades and pastures.

The appearance of a centaur is unmistakable: they have the up-
per torso, arms, and head of a human being and the lower body
of a large, powerful horse.

Centaurs speak their own language and some among them
(about 10%) can converse in the tongue of elves.

Combat: A band of centaurs is always armed, and the leaders
carry shields. Half of the centaurs will be wielding oaken clubs
(the equivalent of morning stars), one quarter will carry compos-
ite bows and have 10-30 arrows (either flight or sheaf, depending
on the current state of affairs in the area). The remainder of the
band will be leaders using medium shields and medium horse
lances. Centaurs make 3 attacks each round in melee: once with
their weapons and twice with their hooves.

Habitat/Society: Centaurs are sociable creatures, taking great
pleasure in the society of others of their kind. Their overall orga-
nization is tribal, with a tribe divided into family groups living to-
gether in harmony. The size of the tribe varies, it range from 3-4
families to upwards of 20 families. Since males have the danger-
ous roles of hunter and protector, females outnumber males by
two to one. The centaur mates for life, and the entire tribe partici-
pates in the education of the young.

The lair is located deep within a forest, and consists of a large,
hidden glade and pasture with a good supply of running water.
Depending upon the climate, the lair may contain huts or lean-tos
to shelter the individual families. Centaurs are skilled in horticul-
ture, and have been known to cultivate useful plants in the vicin-
ity of their lair. In dangerous, monster infested areas, centaurs
will sometimes plant a thick barrier of tough thorn bushes around
their lair and even set traps and snares. In the open area, away
from the trees, are hearths for cooking and warmth. If encoun-
tered in their lair, there will be 1-6 additional males, females equal
to twice the number of males, and 5-30 young. The females (3 Hit
Dice) and the young (1-3 Hit Dice) will fight only with their
hooves, and only in a life or death situation.

Each tribe will have a priest who is treated as a leader but has
the spell abilities of a 3rd level druid.

Centaurs survive through a mixture of hunting, foraging, fish-

 
  

 

 

 

 

 

ing, agriculture and trade. Though they shun dealings with hu-
mans, centaurs have been known to trade with elves, especially
for food and wine. The elves are paid from the group treasury,
which comes from the booty of slain monsters.

The territory of a centaur tribe varies with its size and the na-
ture of the area it inhabits. Centaurs are also not above sharing a
territory with elves. The attitude of a centaur toward a stranger in
its territory will vary with the visitor. Humans and dwarves will
usually be asked to leave in a polite manner, while halflings or
gnomes will be tolerated, and elves will be welcomed. Monsters
will be dealt with in a manner according to the threat they repre-
sent to the welfare and survival of the tribe. Were a giant or
dragon to enter the territory, the centaurs would pull up stakes
and relocate, while trolls and orcs and their like will be killed.

Centaurs will take the treasure of their fallen foes, and are fully
aware of its value. Most male centaurs have a small coin supply,
while the tribe has a treasury which may well include some magi-
cal items. Leaders will have twice the normal individual treasure.
This treasure is used to buy food for the group, or to ransom
(90% likely) captured or threatened members of the tribe.

While basically neutral or chaotic good, centaurs have been
known to become rowdy, boorish, and aggressive when under the
influence of alcohol. They are also extremely protective of their
females and young. Centaurs are basically pastoral, but will react
with violence if their lifestyle and survival is threatened.

Ecology: The centaur lives in close harmony with nature and
spends its lifetime carefully conserving the natural resources
around its lair. The race seems to have an innate knowledge of
how to achieve this precious balance. If forced to chop down a
tree, a centaur will plant another to replace it. Centaurs never
over hunt or over fish an area as a human group might do, but
choose their game with care, limiting the amount they eat.

Giant centipedes are loathsome, crawling arthropods that arouse almost
universal disgust from all intelligent creatures (even other monsters).
They are endemic to most regions.

One of the things which makes the centipede so disagreeable is its re-
semblance to a worm. Its long body is divided into many segments from
which protrude many tiny feet. Hence the name “centipede” (or hundred
footed). The giant centipede is so called because it is over 1' long. The
body of the centipede is plated with chitinous shells and it moves with a
slight undulating motion. The creature also has the added benefit of pro-
tective coloration, and varies in color depending on the terrain it inhabits.
Those that favor rocky areas are gray, those that live underground are
black, while the centipedes of the forest are brown or red.

‘Combat: When hunting, centipedes use their natural coloration to remain un-
seen until they can drop on their prey from above or crawl out of hiding in pur-
suit of food. They attack by biting their foe and injecting a paralytic poison.
Their poison can paralyze a victim for 2-12 (2d6) hours, but is so weak that vic-

tims of a centipede bite are permitted a +4 bonus to their saving throw.

Due to its own small size, the giant centipede is less likely to resist at-
tacks and receives a -1 penalty to all its saving throws.

Although a single giant centipede rarely constitutes a serious threat toa
man, these creatures frequently travel in groups. When more than one
centipede is encountered, the monsters will fight independently, even to
the point of fighting among themselves over fallen victims.

Habitat/Society: The centipede behaves like most other insects, roving
from place to place in search of food. It has no set territory or dwelling.
The centipede simply goes where its hunger leads it. It is an aggressive and
hungry carnivore that must eat at least once a day to survive. Hungry cen-
tipedes will sometimes turn to cannibalism,

Ecology: Giant centipedes have several natural advantages, such as
their poison and protective coloration, which allows them to compete
with other small predators for game. Their poison confers upon them a
certain immunity from being hunted, but hungry and skilled animals such
as wolves and large predatory birds have been known to hunt them effec-
tively in lean times.

Their preferred targets are small mammals which can be easily over-
come by their very weak poison. If they are very hungry, however, they
have been known to attack anything that moves, including humans.

Huge centipedes

These are identical to giant centipedes save that they are only 6” long.
Their poison is even weaker than that of their larger cousins and a victim
which fails its saving throw is immobilized for only 1-6 hours. They make
their own saving throws at -2. The favorite prey of huge centipedes are
mice and other large insects. They in turn are hunted by giant centipedes.

Megalo-centipede

The megalo-centipede is a true giant, growing to over 5’ in length. It is no
longer classed as an irritant but is a threat to human and animal alike. Its acidic
poison is far more potent than that of its weaker cousins. The victims of a
megalo-centipede bite receive no bonuses on their saving throws and failure to
make their roll indicates death. Even if the target successfully resists the poi-
son, the acid burns the victim's skin, inflicting 2-8 (244) points damage.

The megalo-centipede is also more intelligent than its smaller cousins,
and is far more cunning in its hunting (though they still do not cooperate
with each other), In the wilderness the megalo-centipede will prey on ani-
mals the size of deer. In the subterranean environment, it will attack man-
sized or smaller creatures, including orcs, goblins, or humans. The
megalo-centipede receives no penalties to its own saving throws.

How chimerae were created is a dark mystery better left unex-
plored. The chimera has the hindquarters of a large, black goat
and the forequarters of a huge, tawny lion. Its body has
brownish-black wings like those of a dragon.

The monster has three heads, those of a goat, a lion, and a
fierce dragon. The goat head is pitch black, with glowing amber
eyes and long ochre horns. The lion head is framed by a brown
mane and has green eyes. The dragon head is covered with orange
scales and has black eyes.

The chimera speaks a limited form of the foul language of red
dragons. As a rule, however, it will only pause to communicate
with those creatures who are more powerful than itself.

Combat: Its many heads and powerful physique make the chi-
mera a deadly foe in combat. The monster prefers to surprise its
victims, often swooping down upon them from the sky. It can at-
tack 6 times each round, clawing with its forelegs, goring with its
two horns, and biting with its lion and dragon heads. If it desires
to do so, the dragon head can loose a stream of flame some 5
yards long in lieu of biting. The dragon's fire causes 3-24 (3d8)
points damage, although a saving throw versus breath weapon
will cut the damage in half. The chimera will always attempt to
breathe if its opponents are in range. If more than 1 chimera is en-
countered, they will attack in concert.

The armor classes are split as follows: Dragon, AC 2 (flank);
Lion, AC 5 (front); Goat, AC 6 (rear).

Habitat/Society: The chimera, being a hybrid, combines the
preferences of the lion, the goat, and the dragon in its habitat, so-
ciety and ecology. The dragonish part of its nature gives the chi-
mera a distinct preference for caves as lairs. The dragon and lion
parts seem to war with one another, for some chimerae are
dragon-like in their preference for solitude, while others live in
small prides. Even if they mate, offspring are rare.

The monster is an omnivore. The goat head will browse on the
toughest plants and shrubs and will derive nutrition from the
most barren vegetation while the lion and dragon heads can only

 

 

 

 

 

be satisfied with flesh. The chimera hunts once every 3 or 4 days,
using its strength and limited intelligence to gain an advantage
over those it preys on. Having a voracious appetite, it sometimes
roams over territories as large as 20 square miles.

Being chaotic evil in nature, the chimera enjoys preying upon
men, elves, dwarves, and halflings. It will even gladly attack
other monsters in its search for food. Anyone entering its terri-
tory becomes prey, and will be treated accordingly.

The chimera cannot resist attacking groups of travelers or
monsters for another reason: its dragon nature craves the treasure
that its prey might be carrying. Although it has no earthly use for
it, the chimera will gather the coins of its fallen foe into a heap
and roost on it like a dragon. Its hoard is nothing like that of a
true dragon, however, and consists mainly of copper and silver
coins, with perhaps some jewelry and a few magical items.

Ecology: The chimera fills the role of both omnivore and a top
predator in its ecosystem. It is very adaptable. During times when
its prey is scarce or non-existent, the chimera can make do witha
vegetarian diet.

The Gorgimera

The gorgimera has the hindquarters of a gorgon, forequarters of a
lion, and body and wings of a red dragon. Like the chimera, it has
the heads of its three constituent creatures.

The monster can attack with its claws, bite with its lion and
dragon heads, and butt with its gorgon head. In place of making
its normal attack, the gorgon and dragon heads can employ their
breath weapons. While the dragons attack is similar to that of the
chimera, the gorgon’s breath causes petrification to any caught in
its area of effect. The gorgon head can use its breath weapon
twice per day to strike in a cone 3 feet long which is 1 foot wide at
its base and 3 feet wide at its mouth. The gorgimera will always
use one of its breath weapons if its foes are within 10 feet. A save
versus petrification will allow a victim to avoid the effects of the
gorgon’s breath.

The gorgon’s head can see into both the Astral and Ethereal
planes, and its breath weapon extends therein.

Like its relative the chimera, the gorgimera can also speak a
limited form of the language of red dragons.

The cockatrice is an eerie, repulsive hybrid of lizard, cock, and
bat. It is infamous for its ability to turn flesh to stone.

The cockatrice is about the size of a large goose or turkey, and
has the head and body of a cock, with two bat-like wings and the
long tail of a lizard tipped with a few feathers. Its feathers are
golden brown, its beak yellow, its tail green, and its wings gray.
The cockatrice’s wattles, comb, and eyes are bright red.

Females, which are much rarer than males, differ only in that
they have no wattles or comb.

Combat: The cockatrice will fiercely attack anything, human or
otherwise, which it deems a threat to itself or its lair. When at-
tacking, the cockatrice will attempt to grapple with its foe, touch-
ing exposed flesh and turning it to stone. Flocks of cockatrices
will do their utmost to overwhelm and confuse their opponents,
and they will sometimes fly directly into their victims’ faces.

While the fatal touch of a cockatrice’s beak will affect victims
clothed in leather or fabric, it will not work through metal armor.
The touch will, however, extend into the ethereal plane. The
cockatrice is somewhat aware of the limits of its powers, and nat-
ural selection has taught it to strike only at exposed flesh. If large
areas of the opponent's flesh are exposed, it should be assumed
that the cockatrice automatically touches flesh. If the target is
reasonably well armored, the base chance of a cockatrice striking
an area which it can affect is equal to 10% times the adjusted Ar-
mor Class of the victim.

Habitat/Society: The cockatrice is immune to the petrification
powers of others of its kind.

The diet of the cockatrice consists of insects, small lizards and
the like. When it hunts these animals, the creature does not em-
ploy its power to petrify living things.

It is distinguished from other avians by its unusual habits and
nasty temperament. Since females are rare, they are the dominant
sex, and will often have more than one mate. In fact, males will
often fight or strut for the privilege of joining a female's harem.
These mated groups usually build their nests in caves. Nest sites
are permanent, and the cockatrice constantly seeks to decorate its
nesting site by lining it with shining objects like coins and gems.

Females lay 1 or 2 brownish red, rust speckled eggs per month.

 

 

 

 

 

There is only a 25% chance that any given egg will hatch. Those
that are fertile will hatch in 11-19 days. The young reach maturity
and full power within 6 months. Once they achieve adulthood,
the hatchlings are driven away from the nesting site by their par-
ents. Larger groups of cockatrices encountered will frequently be
young driven from the nest who have temporarily united for sur-
vival.

Ecology: The cockatrice thrives in the wilderness. Its petrifica-
tion power makes it immune to most predators, and enables it to
compete with other birds for food. The feathers of the cockatrice
are prized by certain wizards as many magical scrolls must be in-
scribed with pens made from such quills. Many people also seek
unhatched eggs, or even a live cockatrice, as unusual pets or
guardians.

Pyrolisk

Frequently mistaken for its less malignant relative, the pyrolisk is
virtually identical to the cockatrice except for the single red
feather in its tail and the reddish cast of its wings. Whereas the
cockatrice is motivated by instinct alone, the pyrolisk revels in
spreading mayhem. Any victims who fail to save versus death
magic when meeting its gaze will instantly burst into flames,
dying in agony. If the save is made, they are still burnt for 2-13
(1d12 +1) points of damage. Any creature innately or magically
immune to fire will not be affected by its gaze, and anyone who
makes their saving throw is thereafter immune to the gaze of that
particular pyrolisk.

The creature can cause any fire source within 30 yards to ex-
plode in fireworks (as a pyrotechnics spell) once per round.

The pyrolisk is itself immune to all fire-based spells and at-
tacks.

The pyrolisk’s mortal enemy is the phoenix, although any crea-
ture which the monster encounters is likely to be attacked.

The couatl are feathered serpents of myth and lore. It is believed
that they are distant relatives of dragons, although this remains
unproven.

So rare as to be considered almost legendary, the couatl is one
of the most beautiful creatures in existence. It has the body of a
long serpent and feathered wings the color of the rainbow. Since
it has the ability to polymorph, the couatl will sometimes appear
in the form of other creatures (always of good alignment).

Couatl are able to communicate via telepathy with almost any

_ intelligent creature which they encounter. In addition, they can

speak common and most serpent and avian languages.

Combat: A couatl will seldom attack without provocation,
though it will always attack evildoers caught red-handed. When-
ever possible, a couatl will attack from the air.

Since it is highly intelligent, the couatl will frequently use its
spells from a distance before closing with its foes. If more than
one couatl is involved, they will discuss their strategy before a
battle. The couatl will also not hesitate to polymorph into an-
other, more effective form in combat.

The couatl have a variety of abilities which make them more
than a match for most other creatures. In addition to being able to
polymorph themselves at will, a couatl can use magic. Fully 45%
will be 5th level wizards, while 35% can act as 7th level priests.
The remaining 20% are able to use both types of abilities.

In addition to their other magical abilities, couatl can render
themselves and up to 450 pounds of additional matter ethereal at
will. Further, they can detect good/evil, detect magic, turn invisi-
ble, and employ ESP whenever they desire to do so. The oldest
and most powerful of couatl can also use a plane shift on them-
selves and up to 8 others. This ability has a 90% chance of reach-
ing the desired plane.

The couatl uses its poisonous bite and constriction when forced
into melee combat. When it bites it does 1-3 points of damage and
injects a deadly toxin. If the victim fails a save versus poison it is
killed instantly. If the constriction attack succeeds, the victim
takes 2-8 points damage each round until it or the couatl is killed.

Habitat/Society: This winged serpent is native to warm, jungle-
like regions but can also be found flying through the ether. Their
intelligence and goodness has made them objects of reverence by
the natives of the regions which they inhabit. Considered to be di-
vine, there are many legends in which the couatl is the benefactor

   

 

 

 

 

 

of mankind and the bestower of such precious gifts as agriculture
and medicine. There are even shrines in certain areas dedicated to
the couatl, and any who attack or harm a couatl are automati-
cally viewed as the blackest of villains.

Although solitary in nature, couatl think of themselves as a sin-
gle, extended clan. This clan is led by the oldest and wisest of their
numbers but assembles only in dire emergencies.

Most couatl dwell alone, making their lairs in caves and aban-
doned buildings in remote, uninhabited regions. They hunt jun-
gle animals for food once every fortnight or so. Many enjoy
traveling, often undertaking long journeys of exploration.

On rare occasions, a pair will mate for life and establish a joint
lair, Unlike many other reptiles, the couatl bear live young. Births
are rare, averaging only one per couple each century. Both par-
ents participate in the rearing and education of the single off-
spring, and will fight to the death if their child is threatened.
Young couatl reach maturity in thirty or forty years and, though
some will elect to remain with their parents for as long as a cen-
tury, will eventually set off in search of the couatl’s never-ending
quest for wisdom.

Intellectually curious, all couatl have vast stores of informa-
tion and enjoy learning more. When one of them learns some new
and fascinating fact he will inevitably set out in search of his
brethren to share and discuss it.

Couatl can sometimes be persuaded to help good adventurers
or give sound council. If they feel that they are being sought for
frivolous reasons, they will simply fly away. They are not greedy
and do not seek treasure for its own sake. Aid from a couatl may
well take the form of a magical item from its hoard.

Ecology: The couatl usually reigns supreme in its jungle, having
little to fear from most other monsters.

Displacer Beast

SPECIAL ATTACKS: Nil

SIZE: L (8'- 12’ long)

MORALE: Elite (13-14)

XP VALUE: 975

The displacer beast is a magical creature which resembles a puma
with two powerful black tentacles growing from its shoulders.
They are very rare, and inhabit spots far from human lands.

The displacer beast has the blue-black coloring of a dark pan-
ther with a long cat-like body and head. Females range in size
from 8' to 9’, and weigh 450 pounds. Males can vary in size from
10’ to 12’, and weigh up to 500 Ibs. Unlike the panther, however,
the displacer beast has 6 legs. Its black tentacles are tipped with
rough horny edges which can inflict terrible wounds upon its
foes. The eyes of a displacer beast glow bright green even after the
death of the creature itself.

Combat: The displacer beast is a fierce, savage creature which
hates all forms of life. Highly aggressive, the displacer beast will
attack on sight, using its tentacles to inflict 2-8 (2d4) points of
damage to its victims.

Their main advantage in combat, however, stems from their
magical power of displacement, which causes them to appear to
be some 3’ from their actual location. Anyone attacking a dis-
placer beast receives a -2 on his attack roll. In addition, these
monsters make their saving throws as 12th level fighters, gaining
an additional +2 to their die roll.

To determine the true position of the displacer beast and its illu-
sionary form roll 1d10. On a result of 1-5 the illusion is in front of
the creature, 6-7 to the creature's left, 8-9, to the right, and 10 the
the illusion is behind the actual position of the beast. Although
the displacement ability is magical, the location of the animal will
not be revealed by a dispel or detect magic. Only true seeing will
reveal the true position of the displacer beast.

Displacer beasts will not use their claws or teeth unless near
death or when fighting a very large opponent. If they do employ
these secondary weapons each claw does 1-3 points of damage,
and each bite does 1-8 points of damage.

Habitat/Society: Displacer beasts are carnivores who survive
by hunting. Unless they are in the process of raising young, they
generally run in packs, carving a savage swath of destruction as
they go. They hate all life, and will sometimes kill purely for plea-
sure. Fierce and vicious as they are, however, displacer beasts
never fight among themselves. The pack is a well-run and highly
efficient killing machine. When encountered en masse, displacer
beasts are more than a match for many large creatures and have

 

 

 

 

 

been known to make a meal of orcs, goblins, and bands of men.
Any being entering their terrain is viewed as potential prey.

Displacer beasts mate in the autumn, and the young are born in
the spring. A mated pair of displacer beasts makes its home in a
cave, producing litters of 1-4 young. The cubs, about the size of
domestic cats, are born without tentacles and reach maturity, but
not full size, within 4 months. They remain in the cave until their
displacement abilities are fully developed. This is followed by a2
month period during which the cubs are taught how to hunt by
their parents. When this is completed, the family group disbands
and the monsters wander off to join separate packs. While raising
young, however, the monsters are fiercely protective of their lair.
One adult will always remain with the cubs, usually the female,
while the other goes off to hunt. Dead prey will be dragged back
to the lair to be devoured by the entire family. The lair of a dis-
placer beast family is littered with the bones, equipment, and
treasures of its victims.

Naturally vicious and almost evil at times, the displacer beast
has an undying hatred of the blink dog. Many theories abound to
account for this enmity. Some say it springs from antipathy in
temperaments, and that the lawful good blink dog would natu-
rally be the enemy of a creature as savage and destructive as the
displacer beast. Some argue that it is the displacement and blink-
ing abilities which are the cause for this antipathy, and that the
two abilities, when in close proximity, somehow stimulate the
nervous system and produce a hostile reaction. Encounters be-
tween the two kinds are rare however, since they do not share the
same territory.

Ecology: The displacer beast has little to fear from other large
predators, save perhaps large trolls or giants. Some wizards and
alchemists value the hide of displacer beasts for use in certain
magical preparations, and will offer generous rewards for them.
The eyes of a displacer beast are a highly prized, if uncommon,
good luck charm among thieves who believe that they will pro-
tect the bearer from detection.

Smaller than wolves, the appearance of the wild dog varies from
place to place. Most appear very wolf-like, while others seem to com-
bine the looks of a wolf and a jackal.

Combat: Wild dogs fight as an organized pack. They favor small
game, and attack men and human habitations only in times of great
hunger. The bite of a wild dog inflicts 1-4 points of damage.

Habitat/Society: wild dogs are found almost anywhere. They run
in packs, and are led by the dominant male. The pack usually hunts a
variety of game, even attacking deer or antelope. Pups are born in the
spring. Wild dogs can be tamed if separated from their pack.

Ecology: Wild dogs are omnivores which usually thrive on a combi-
nation of hunting and foraging.

War Dogs

Generally large mastiffs or wolfhounds, they have keen senses of
smell and hearing, making them adept at detecting intruders. Most
war dogs are not usually vicious, and will rarely attack without
cause.

The status of war dogs varies greatly; some are loyal and beloved
pets, some are watch dogs, others are hunting dogs, and some are
trained for battle.

Blink Dogs

Blink dogs are yellowish brown canines which are stockier and more
muscular than other wild dogs. They are intelligent and employ a lim-
ited form of teleportation when they hunt.

A blink dog attack is well organized. They will blink to and fro
without any obvious pattern, using their powers to position them-
selves for an attack. Fully 75% of the time they are able to attack their
targets from the rear. A dog will teleport on a roll of 7 or better ona
12-sided die. To determine where the dog appears, roll a 12-sided die:
1 = in front of opponent, 2 = shielded (or left) front flank, 3 = un-
shielded (or right) front flank, 4-12 = behind. When blinking, the
dog will appear from 1' to 3’ feet from its opponent and will immedi-
ately be able to attack,

Blinking is an innate power and the animal will never appear inside
a space occupied by a solid object. If seriously threatened, the entire
pack will blink out and not return.

Blink dogs are intelligent, and communicate in a complex language
of barks, yaps, whines, and growls. They inhabit open plains and
avoid human haunts. A lair will contain 3-12 (3d4) pups 50% of the
time (1-2 hit dice, 1-2/1-3 hit points damage/attack). These puppies
can be trained and are worth between 1,000 to 2,000 gold pieces.

Death dog

Death dogs are large two-headed hounds which are distinguished by
their penetrating double bark. Death dogs hunt in large packs.

Each head is independent, and a bite does 1-10 points of damage.
Victims must save versus poison or contract a rotting disease which
will kill them in 4-24 (4d6) days. Only a cure disease spell can save
them. A natural roll of 19 or 20 on their attack die means that a man-
sized opponent is knocked prone and attacks at a -4 until able to rise
to its feet again. There is an 85% chance that death dogs will attack
humans on sight.

 
Dragons

 

 

Dragons are an ancient, winged reptilian race. They are known and
feared for their size, physical prowess, and magical abilities. The 10 sub-
species of dragons are identified by the color of their scales. Each sub-
species has 12 age categories. The oldest dragons are among the most
powerful creatures in the world,

Dragons range in size from several feet upon hatching to more than 100
feet after they have attained the status of great wyrm. The exact size varies
according to age and subspecies. A dragon's wing span is about equal to
its body length and fully 15-20% of a dragon’s body length is its neck.

Dragons, especially older ones, are generally solitary due to necessity
and preference. They distance themselves from civilization, which they
consider to be a petty and foolish mortal invention.

Although dragons’ goals and ideals vary between subspecies, all
dragons are covetous. They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of
coins and gathering as many gems, jewels, and magic items as possible.
They find the treasure pleasing to look at and bask in the radiance of the
magic items. For a dragon, there is never enough treasure, and those with
large hoards are loathe to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs
only to patrol the immediate area or to get food. Dragons like to make
beds of their treasure, shaping nooks and mounds to fit their bodies, and
by the time they have matured to the great wyrm state hundreds of gems
and coins have become imbedded in their hides.

Dragons are fearsome predators, but will scavenge when necessary and
can eat almost anything if they are hungry enough. A dragon's metabo-
lism operates like a highly efficient furnace, making use of 95% of all the
food the dragon eats. A dragon can also metabolize inorganic material,
and some dragons have a taste for such fare.

Generally, when multiple dragons are encountered they will be a mated
pair and young. Mated pairs never will be found together above the ma-
ture adult stage, and the young will be of the young adult stage or youn-
ger. To determine the age of young dragons roll a 6-sided die: 1 = egg; 2 =
hatchling; 3 = very young; 4 = young; 5 = juvenile; 6 = young adult.

During the early part of a dragon's young adult stage it will leave its
parents, greed driving it on to start a lair of its own. Sometimes, although
rarely, juvenile dragons will leave their parents to start their own lives. As
a pair of mated dragons age beyond the mature adult stage, they split up,
independence and the lust for treasure driving them apart. Older dragons
of either sex will sometimes raise young, but only on their own—the other
parent leaves when the eggs are laid.

Although all subspecies of dragons are believed to have come from the

same roots tens of thousands of years ago, the present subspecies keep to
themselves, working together only when they are significantly threat-
ened; good dragons never work with evil dragons. While good dragons of
different subspecies are more tolerant of each other, they also are territo-
rial. Only gold and silver dragons have been known to freely associate—
and those instances are uncommon.
Dragon Hit Die Modifier: Dragons’ Hit Dice vary between subspecies
and are modified based on age category. Refer to individual dragons for
base hit die information but the modifier is listed on the overall dragon
chart. The older a dragon gets, the more Hit Dice it will have while youn-
ger dragons will have fewer. For example, a black dragon has 10 Hit Dice
as a base. A hatchling black dragon subtracts 6 dice, which gives it a total
of 4 hit dice. A great wyrm black dragon adds 8 dice, which gives it a total
of 18 hit dice.

Dragons’ saving throws are tied to their hit dice, Each dragon saves as a
fighter equal in level to the dragon's hit dice, For example, a hatchling
black dragon saves as a 4th level fighter, while a great wyrm black dragon
saves as an 18th level fighter.

Dragon Combat Modifier: A dragon's combat modifier varies with the
age category. The bonus or penalty applies to both attack and damage
rolls for each physical attack. It does not apply to a dragon's breath
weapon.

Dragon Attacks: AJ] dragons have a claw/claw/bite attack form and a
breath weapon. A dragon can use its breath weapon once every three
combat rounds. Dragons also employ the attack forms of snatch, kick,
tail slap, and wing buffet if their age and the prevailing conditions allow
it. Dragons frequently divide their attacks between opponents, using the
more dangerous attacks, such as a bite, against the foes it perceives to be
the toughest.

Claw: Claws can attack creatures to the front and sides of the dragon.
If the dragon kicks with one rear leg, it can use only one claw (the other
must be used to maintain balance).

Bite: Because of a dragon’s long neck, it can bite creatures to its front
or to either side.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Snatch: Only young adult and older dragons can snatch. A flying
dragon dives and attempts to grab a creature in one of its claws. A creature
struck by this method will be taken into the air. There is a 50% chance that a
snatched creature has its arms pinned, and therefore will not be able to
physically attack the dragon. Snatched creatures are sometimes taken to
great heights and dropped. The snatched creature can be squeezed in the
claw for automatic claw damage each round, or transferred to the dragon’s
mouth. The transfer requires a successful attack roll. If the transfer suc-
ceeds, the victim automatically takes bite damage each round. If it fails, the
victim is dropped. Old and older dragons can carry a victim in each claw,
and can try to snatch two victims at once. Wyrms and great wyrms can
carry three victims, but one must be transferred from claw to mouth first. A
dragon only can snatch creatures two or more size categories smaller than it-
self. For example, a dragon that is 45' long is a Gargantuan creature, so the
biggest creature it can snatch is a Large one (12’).

Kick: Any dragon can kick creatures attacking it from behind, A kick
delivers claw damage, and creatures struck must roll their Dexterity or
less on 1420 or be kicked back 1d6 feet +1 foot per age category of the
dragon. For example, a mature adult dragon will kick a foe 1d6 +7 feet.
Creatures knocked back must save versus petrification (adjusted accord-
ing to the dragon's combat modifier) or fall. If the dragon attacks with one
claw, it can only kick with one hind leg as the other must be used to main-
tain balance. A dragon cannot slap with its tail while kicking.

Wing Buffet: Young adult and older dragons can employ their wings
in combat. Targets must be at the dragon’s sides. The damage inflicted is
the same as a claw attack, and creatures struck must roll their Dexterity or
less on 1d20 or be knocked prone.

Tail Slap: Adult and older dragons can use their tails to attack crea-
tures behind them. A tail attack inflicts the same damage as two claws and
affects a number of creatures equal to the dragon's age category. For ex-
ample, an adult dragon can hit up to six creatures. Creatures within the
sweep of the dragon's tail must save versus petrification or be stunned for
2-5 (1d4 +1) minutes. A tail slap can smash a light wooden structure and
even damage a cube of force (one charge per two points of the dragon's
combat modifier, rounded down).

Spells: Dragons acquire spells haphazardly over the years. The DM
should randomly determine which spells any particular dragon knows.
Each spell can be used once a day. If the random determination indicates
the same spell more than once, the dragon can use it more than once a day.
A dragon's spells are innate and are triggered by thought. Dragons do not
possess spell books, nor do they pray to their deities. The dragon simply
needs to concentrate for a second and its spell is cast.

Dragon Defenses: A dragon's Armor Class improves as it gets older
because the dragon's hide and general constitution becomes tougher. Old

 
Dragons

or older dragons are immune to normal missiles; their gem-encrusted
hides deflect arrows and other small projectiles. Large missiles (from cata-
pults, giants, et.al.), and magical missiles affect them normally. Young
adult and older dragons radiate a personal aura that makes them resistant
to harmful magic cast at them. A dragon's magic resistance is a function of
its personal power, and as a dragon becomes older and tougher, its magic
resistance increases.

Dragon t; Despite their large size, dragons are graceful and com-
petent ‘ten ail dragons have a maneuverability class C.

A dragon can change direction quickly by executing a wingover ma-
neuver. A dragon cannot gain altitude during a minute when it performs a
wingover, but it may dive. The maneuver allows the dragon to make a
turn of 120 to 240 degrees regardless of its speed or size.

Diving dragons can strike with their claws at +2 on their attack roll.
When engaging other flying opponents, dragons can either claw or bite,
but not both.

Dragon Senses: All dragons have excellent sight, smell, and hearing.
Their increased senses allow them to detect invisible objects and creatures
(including creatures or items hidden in darkness or fog) within a 10-foot
radius per age category. All dragons possess a natural clairaudience abil-
ity with respect to their lairs; the range is 20 feet per age category. The
dragon must concentrate on a specific section within its lair or surround-
ing area to hear what is going on.

Some dragons have the ability to speak, and possess a telepathic ability
that allows them to converse with any intelligent creature. The percentage
chance for a dragon to speak varies based on each subspecies’ intelligence
and each dragon’s age category. Refer to individual dragons for the per-
centages.

n Fear: Dragons can inspire panic or fear. The mere sight of a
young adult or older dragon causes humans and demi-humans with fewer
than one Hit Die and non-aggressive creatures with fewer Hit Dice than
the dragon to automatically flee in panic for 4-24 (4d6) minutes.

Other humans, demi-humans, and creatures can be stricken with fear if
they are within the dragon's fear aura. All creatures with Hit Dice equal to
or greater than the dragon are immune to the fear effect. The aura sur-
rounds attacking or charging dragons in the specified radius. Humans,
demi-humans, and creatures not automatically panicked are entitled to a
save versus petrification, Those failing their saves are stricken with fear
and fight at a -2 penalty on their attack and damage rolls.

A dragon's fear aura size varies with the dragon's age category; refer to
individual dragons for specific information. The aura increases in power
based on the age category of the dragon, and those who are subjected to
the aura adjust their saving throws based on the dragon's fear save modi-
fier. For example, characters fighting a mature adult dragon add 1 to their
saving throws while those fighting a great wyrm subtract 4.

Lairs: All dragon lairs are far from mortal civilizations, and
they are difficult to find because the dragons take careful measures to
cloak their comings and goings. There is usually little, if any, wildlife
around the lairs because neighboring creatures fear the dragons, and the
dragons eat the few creatures which are foolish enough to remain.

When a young adult dragon leaves its parents in search of its own lair, it
will spend a few years moving from place to place to find a cave or cavern
which best suits its personality. In most cases, the dragons search for in-
creasingly larger caves which can easily accommodate them as they grow.
Usually by the time a dragon has reached the mature adult stage it will
have selected a large lair it plans to keep for the remainder of its life. A
dragon at this stage has gathered a considerable amount of treasure and
will be loathe to move it to a different location.

The location and character of dragon lairs vary based on each sub-
species. Consult individual dragons for specific information. However,
one thing remains constant: all dragons consider their lair and the imme-
diate area around it their domain. A creature which encroaches or threat-
ens the lair is threatening the dragon and will be dealt with harshly. Some
good dragons may be more lenient than other subspecies in this matter.
All dragons keep their treasure hidden deep within their lairs, and some
dragons will create hazardous conditions within their lairs to keep un-
wary creatures from reaching the treasure.

Dragon Hide: Dragon skin is prized by armorers with the skill to turn
it into shields and armor. This armor is valuable because of its appearance
and because of the protection it affords. The older the dragon the skin is
from, the better the protection it provides. Dragon armor will grant its
wearer an armor class of 4 less than the Armor Class of the dragon it was
taken from, for a minimum Armor Class of 8. For example, armor taken
from a juvenile brass dragon (which has an AC of 0) will grant its wearer

 

an Armor Class of 4 and armor from a very old brass dragon (AC -4) will
grant its wearer an armor class of 0. Dragon armor is supple and non-
bulky, weighing only 25 pounds.

Dragon armor affords no extra protection, such as resistance to fire or
cold, although the armor can be enchanted to provide such protection. A
dragon’s resistance to certain elements is based on its total makeup, not
just its skin. Plain dragon armor is expensive to make, costing between
1,000 and 10,000 gold pieces, based on the workmanship and protection
the armor affords. Dragon skin armor can be enchanted, just as other
forms of armor can, to a maximum of +5.

Dragon shields also offer no additional protection. They are made of
stretched hide over a wooden frame. Such shields weigh 3 pounds (if
small) or 8 pounds (if large) and cost 20 to 120 or 30 to 180 gold pieces.

Blue dragons are extremely territorial and voracious. They love to spend
long hours preparing ambushes for herd animals and unwary travelers,
and they spend equally long hours dwelling on their success and admiring
their trophies.

The size of a blue dragon's scales increases little as the dragon ages, al-
though they do become thicker and harder. The scales vary in color from
an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, retaining a glossy finish through all of
the dragon's stages because the blowing desert sands polish them. This
makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surroundings. However,
the dragons often conceal themselves, burrowing into the sand so only
part of their heads are exposed.

Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air; usually flying in the daytime
when temperatures are the highest. Some blue dragons nearly match the color
of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage in combat.

Blue dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all evil
dragons, and 12% of hatchling blue dragons have an ability to communi-
cate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability in-
creases 5% per age category of the dragon.

Combat: Blue dragons prefer to fight from a distance so their opponents
can clearly witness the full force of their breath weapon and so little or no
threat is posed to themselves. Often blue dragons will attack from directly
above or will burrow beneath the sands until opponents come within 100
feet. Older blue dragons will use their special abilities, such as hallucina-
tory terrain, in concert with these tactics to mask the land and aid in their
chances to surprise. Blue dragons will only run from a fight if they are se-
verely damaged, as they also view retreat as cowardly.

Breath weapow/special abilities: 4 b|ye dragon’s breath weapon is a 5'
wide bolt of lightning that streaks 100’ in a straight line from the dragon's
mouth. All creatures caught in this stream must save vs. breath weapon

for half damage. Blue dragons cast spells and use their magical abilities at
7th level, adjusted by their combat modifier.

Blue dragons are born with an immunity to electricity. As they age,
they gain the following additional powers: Young: create or destroy water
three times per day. Juvenile: sound imitation at will. Adult: dust devil
once a day. Old: ventriloquism once a day. Venerable: control winds once
a day, Great wyrm: hallucinatory terrain once a day.

Habitat/Society: Blue dragons are found in deserts; arid, windswept
plains; and hot, humid badlands. They enjoy the bleak terrain because
there are few obstacles—only an occasional rock outcropping or dune—
to interrupt the view of their territories. They spend hours looking out
over their domains, watching for trespassers and admiring their property.
Most of the blue dragons encountered will be alone because they do not
want to share their territories with others. However, when a family is en-
countered the male dragon will attack ferociously, protecting his
property—his mate and young. The female dragon also will join in the at-
tack if the threat proves significant.

Blue dragons’ enemies are men, who kill the dragons for their skin and
treasure, and brass dragons, which share the same environment. If a blue
dragon discovers a brass dragon in the same region, it will not rest until
the trespassing dragon is killed or driven away.

Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns in which they store their
treasure. Although blue dragons will collect anything which looks valu-
able, they are fond of gems—especially sapphires.

Ecology: Blue dragons are able to consume nearly anything, and some-
times are forced to eat snakes, lizards, and desert plants to help sate their
great hunger. However, they are particularly fond of herd animals, such
as camels, and they will gorge themselves on caravans of the creatures
which they have cooked with a lightning bolt.

Brass dragons are great talkers, but not particularly good conversational-
ists. They are egotistical and often boorish. They often have useful infor-
mation, but will divulge it only after drifting off the subject many times
and after hints that a gift would be appreciated.

At birth, a brass dragon’s scales are dull. Their color is a brassy, mottled
brown. As the dragon gets older, the scales become more brassy, until
they reach a warm, burnished appearance.

Combat: Brass dragons would rather talk than fight. If an intelligent
creature tries to take its leave of a brass dragon without talking to it at
length, the dragon might have a fit of pique and try to force a conversa-
tion with suggestion or by giving the victim a dose of sleep gas. If the vic-
tim falls asleep it will awaken to find itself pinned under the dragon or
buried to the neck in the sand until the dragon’s thirst for small talk is
slaked. Before melee, brass dragons create a cloud of dust with dust devil
or control winds, then charge or snatch. Brass dragons often use contro!
temperature to create heat to discomfort their opponents. When faced
with real danger, younger brass dragons will fly out of sight, then hide by
burrowing. Older dragons spurn this ploy.

Breath weapon/special abilities: A brass dragon has two breath weap-
‘ons: a cone of sleep gas 70' long, 5’ wide at the dragon's mouth, and 20’
wide at its end; or a cloud of blistering desert heat 50’ long, 40’ wide, and
20’ high. Creatures caught in the gas, regardless of Hit Dice or level, must
save vs. breath weapon or fall asleep for 10 minutes per age level of the
dragon. Creatures caught in the heat take damage, save vs. breath
weapon for half. A brass dragon casts its spells and uses its magical abili-
ties at 6th level, plus its combat modifier.

At birth, brass dragons can speak with animals freely, and are immune
to fire and heat. As they age, they gain the following additional powers:

Young: create or destroy water three times a day. Juvenile: dust devil once
a day. Adult: suggestion once a day. Mature adult: control temperature 3
times a day in a 10’ radius per age level. Old: control winds once a day.
Great wyrm: Summon djinni once a week. The dragon usually asks the
djinni to preform some service. Although the djinni serves willingly, the
dragon will order it into combat only in extreme circumstances, as the
dragon would be dismayed and embarrassed if the djinni were killed.

Habitat/Society: Brass dragons are found in arid, warm climates; rang-
ing from sandy deserts to dry steppes. They love intense, dry heat and
spend most of their time basking in the sun. They lair in high caves, pref-
erably facing east where the sun can warm the rocks, and their territories
always contain several spots where they can bask and trap unwary tray-
elers into conversation.

Brass dragons are very social. They usually are on good terms with
neighboring brass dragons and sphinxes. Brass dragons are dedicated par-
ents. If their young are attacked they will try to slay the enemy, using their
heat breath weapons and taking full advantage of their own immunity.

Because they share the same habitat, blue dragons are brass dragons’
worst enemies. Brass dragons usually get the worst of a one-on-one con-
frontation, mostly because of the longer reach of the blue dragon’s breath
weapon. Because of this, brass dragons usually try to evade blue dragons
until they can rally their neighbors for a mass attack.

Ecology: Like other dragons, brass dragons can, and will, eat almost
anything if the need arises. In practice, however, they eat very little. They
are able to get nourishment from morning dew, a rare commodity in their
habitat, and have been seen carefully lifting it off plants with their long
tongues.

Bronze dragons are inquisitive and fond of humans and demi-humans.
They enjoy polymorphing into small, friendly animals so they can unob-
trusively observe humans and demi-humans, especially adventurers.
Bronze dragons thrive on simple challenges such as riddles and harmless
contests. They are fascinated by warfare and will eagerly join an army if
the cause is just and the pay is good.

At birth, a bronze dragon's scales are yellow tinged with green, show-
ing only a hint of bronze. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color
deepens slowly changing to a rich bronze tone that gets darker as the
dragon ages. Dragons from the very old stage and on develop a blue-black
tint to the edges of their scales, similar to a patina on ancient bronze ar-
mor or statues.

Bronze dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all good
dragons, and 16% of hatchling bronze dragons have an ability to commu-
nicate with any intelligent creature, The chance to possess this ability in-
creases 5% per age category of the dragon.

Combat: Bronze dragons dislike killing creatures with animal intelli-
gence and would rather bribe them (perhaps with food), or force them
away with repulsion. When confronted with intelligent opponents bronze
dragons use their ESP ability to learn their opponents’ intentions. When
attacking they blind their opponents with wall of fog, then charge. Or, if
they are flying, they will snatch opponents. When fighting under water,
they use airy water to maintain the effectiveness of their breath weapons,
and to keep away purely aquatic opponents. Against boats or ships they
summon a storm or use their tail slap to smash the vessels’ hulls. If the
dragon is inclined to be lenient, seafaring opponents might merely find
themselves becalmed, fog bound, or with broken masts.

At birth, bronze dragons have a water breathing ability, can speak with
animals at will, and are immune to electricity. As they age, they gain the
following additional powers: Young: create food and water and poly-
morph self three times a day. (Each change in form lasts until the dragon
chooses a different form. Reverting to the dragon's normal form does not
count as a change.) Juvenile: wall of fog once a day. Adult: ESP three
times a day. Mature adult: airy water three times a day in a 10' radius per
age category of the dragon. Old: weather summoning once a day.

Habitat/Society: Bronze dragons like to be near deep fresh or salt water.
They are good swimmers and often visit the depths to cool off or to hunt
for pearls or treasure from sunken ships. They prefer caves that are acces-
sible only from the water, but their lairs are always dry—they do not lay
eggs, sleep, or store treasure under water.

Bronze dragons are fond of sea mammals, especially dolphins and
whales. These animals provide the dragons with a wealth of information
on shipwrecks, which the dragons love to plunder, and detail the haunts
of large sharks. Bronze dragons detest pirates, disabling or destroying
their ships.

Ecology: Bronze dragons eat aquatic plants and some varieties of sea-
food. They especially prize of shark meat. They also dine on an occa-
sional pearl, and, like other dragons, can eat almost anything in a pinch.
Evil, amphibious sea creatures (particularly sahuagin), who can invade
their air filled lairs, are their greatest enemies.

Copper dragons are incorrigible pranksters, joke tellers, and riddlers.
They are prideful and are not good losers, although they are reasonably
good winners. They are particularly selfish and greedy for their align-
ment, and have an almost neutral outlook where wealth is concerned.

At birth, a copper dragon’s scales have a ruddy brown color with a cop-
per tint. As the dragon gets older, the scales become finer and more cop-
pery, assuming a soft, warm gloss by the time the dragon becomes a
young adult, Beginning at the venerable stage, the dragons’ scales pick up
a green tint.

Copper dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all good
dragons, and 14% of hatchling copper dragons have an ability to commu-
nicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability in-
creases 5% per age category of the dragon.

Combat: Copper dragons like to taunt and annoy their opponents, hop-
ing they will give up or become angry and act foolishly. Early in an
encounter, a copper dragon will jump from one side of an opponent to an-
other, landing on inaccessible or vertical stone surfaces. If there are no
such places around a dragon’s lair, the dragon will create them ahead of
time using stone shape, move earth, and wall of stone. An angry copper
dragon will mire its opponents using rock to mud, and will force victims
who escape the mud into it with kicks. Once opponents are trapped in the
mud, the dragon will crush them with a wall of stone or snatch them and
carry them aloft. When fighting airborne opponents, a dragon will draw
its enemies into narrow, stony gorges where it can use its spider climb
ability in an attempt to maneuver the enemy into colliding with the walls.

Breath weapon/special abilities: A copper dragon's breath weapon is ei-
ther a cloud of slow gas 30’ long, 20' wide, and 20’ high or a spurt of acid
70' long and 5’ wide. Creatures caught in the gas must save vs. breath
weapon or be slowed for three minutes per age level of the dragon. Crea-

tures caught in the acid take damage, save vs. breath weapon for half. A
copper dragon casts its spells and uses its magical abilities at 7th level, plus
its combat modifier.

At birth, copper dragons can spider climb (stone surfaces only) and are
immune to acid. As they age, they gain the following additional powers:
Young: neutralize poison three times a day. Juvenile: stone shape twice a
day. Adult: forget once a day. Mature adult: rock to mud once a day. Old:
move earth once a day. Great wyrm: wall of stone once a day. A copper
dragon can jump 30 yards forward or sideways, reaching heights up to 20’
at mid jump. They can jump 30’ straight up.

Habitat/Society: Copper dragons like dry, rocky uplands and moun-
tains. They lair in narrow caves and often conceal the entrances using
move earth and stone shape. Within the lair, they construct twisting
mazes with open tops. These allow the dragons to fly or jump over in-
truders struggling through the maze.

Copper dragons appreciate wit, and will usually leave good or neutral
creatures alone if they can relate a joke, humorous story, or riddle the
dragon has not heard before. They quickly get annoyed with creatures
who don’t laugh at their jokes or do not accept the dragon’s tricks and an-
tics with good humor.

Because they often inhabit hills in sight of red dragons lairs conflicts be-
tween the two subspecies often occur. Copper dragons usually run for
cover until they can equal the odds.

Ecology: Copper dragons are determined hunters, the good sport a hunt
provides is at least as important as they food they get. They are known to
eat almost anything, including metal ores. However, they prize giant scor-
pions and other large poisonous creatures (they say the venom sharpens
their wit). The dragon's digestive system can handle the venom safely, al-
though injected venoms affect them normally.

Gold dragons are wise, judicious, and benevolent. They often embark on self-
appointed quests to promote goodness, and are not easily distracted from
them. They hate injustice and foul play. A gold dragon frequently assumes hu-
man or animal guise and usually will be encountered disguised.

At birth, a gold dragon's scales are dark yellow with golden metallic
flecks. The flecks get larger as the dragon matures until, at the adult stage,
the scales grow completely golden.

Gold dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all good
dragons, and 18% of hatchling gold dragons have an ability to communi-
cate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability in-
creases 5% per age category of the dragon.

Combat: Gold dragons usually parley before combat. When conversing
with intelligent creatures they use detect lie and detect gems spells to gain
the upper hand. In combat, they quickly use bless and luck bonus. Older
dragons use luck bonus at the start of each day if the duration is a day or
more. They make heavy use of spells in combat. Among their favorites
are sleep, stinking cloud, slow, fire shield, cloudkill, globe of invulnera-
bility, delayed blast fireball, and maze.

Breath weapon/special abilities: A gold dragon has two breath weap-
ons: a cone of fire 90’ long, 5' wide at the dragon's mouth, and 30’ wide at
the end or a cloud of potent chlorine gas 50’ long, 40’ wide, and 30’ high.
Creatures caught in either effect are entitled to a save versus breath
weapon for half damage.

A gold dragon casts its spells and uses its magical abilities at 11th level,
plus its combat modifier. Unlike other dragons, most gold dragons seek
formal magical training. These dragons own spell books and always have
useful spells.

At birth, gold dragons have water breathing ability, can speak with ani-
mals freely, and are immune to fire and gas. They can also polymorph self
three times a day. Each change in form lasts until the dragon chooses a dif-

ferent form; reverting to the dragon's normal form does not count as a
change. A gold dragon's natural form has wings. However, they some-
times choose a wingless form to facilitate swimming, gaining the higher
swimming rate listed above. A gold dragon in any wingless form can fly at
a speed of 6 (MC E).

As they age, they gain the following additional powers: Young: bless three
times a day. Juvenile: detect lie three times a day. Adult: animal summoning
once a day. Mature adult: luck bonus once a day. Old: quest once a day, and
detect gems three times a day. (This allows the dragon to know the number
and kind of precious stones within a 30’ radius, duration is one minute.

The luck bonus power of mature adults is used to aid good adventurers.
By touch, the dragon can enchant one gem to bring good luck. The gem is
usually one which has been embedded in the dragon's hide. When the
dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature in a 10' radius per age
category of the dragon receives a +1 bonus to all Saving Throws and sim-
ilar dice rolls, cf. stone of good luck. If the dragon gives a gem to another
creature only the bearer gets the bonus. The enchantment lasts three
hours per age category of the dragon, plus 1-3 hours. The enchantment
ends if the gem is destroyed before its duration expires.

Habitat/Society: Gold dragons can live anywhere. Their lairs are se-
cluded and always made of solid stone, either caves or castles. These usu-
ally have loyal guards: either animals appropriate to the terrain, or storm
or good cloud giants. The giants usually serve as guards through a mutual
defensive agreement.

Ecology: Gold dragons can eat almost anything. However, they usually
sustain themselves on pearls or small gems. Gold dragons who receive
pearls and gems from good or neutral creatures usually will be favorably
inclined toward the gift bringers, as long as the gift is not presented as a
crass bribe. In the latter case, the dragon will accept the gift, but react cyn-
ically to any requests the giver makes.

Green dragons are bad tempered, mean, cruel, and rude. They hate good-
ness and good-aligned creatures. They love intrigue and seek to enslave
other woodland creatures, killing those who cannot be controlled or in-
timidated.

A hatchling green dragon's scales are thin, very small, and a deep shade
of green that appears nearly black. As the dragon ages, the scales grow
larger and become lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive
green, which helps it blend in with its wooded surroundings. A green
dragon's scales never become as thick as other dragons’, remaining
smooth and flexible.

Green dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all evil
dragons, and 12% of hatchling green dragons have an ability to commu-
nicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability in-
creases 5% per age category of the dragon.

Combat: Green dragons initiate fights with little or no provocation,
picking on creatures of any size. If the target creature intrigues the dragon
or appears to be difficult to deal with, the dragon will stalk the creature,
using its environment for cover, until it determines the best time to strike
and the most appropriate tactics to use. If the target appears formidable,
the dragon will first attack with its breath weapon, magical abilities, and
spells. However, if the target appears weak, the dragon will make its pres-
ence known quickly for it enjoys evoking terror in its targets. When the
dragon has tired of this game, it will bring down the creature using its
physical attacks so the fight lasts longer and the creature's agony is pro-
longed.

Sometimes, the dragon elects to control a creature, such as a human or
demi-human, through intimidation and suggestion. Green dragons like to
question men, especially adventurers, to learn more about their society,
abilities, what is going on in the countryside, and if there is treasure
nearby.

Breath weapon/special abilities: A green dragon's breath weapon is a cloud
of poisonous chlorine gas that is 50’ long, 40’ wide, and 30 feet high. Creatures
within the cloud may save versus breath weapon for half damage. A green
dragon casts its spells at 6th level, adjusted by its combat modifier.

From birth, green dragons are immune to gasses. As they age, they gain
the following additional powers: Juvenile: water breathing. Adult: sug-
gestion once a day. Mature adult: warp wood three times a day. Old: plant
growth once a day. Very old: entangle once a day. Wyrm: pass without
trace three times a day.

Habitat/Society: Green dragons are found in sub-tropical and temperate
forests, the older the forest and bigger the trees, the better. The sights and
smells of the woods are pleasing to the dragon, and it considers the entire
forest or woods its territory. Sometimes the dragon will enter into a relation-
ship with other evil forest-dwelling creatures, which keep the dragon in-
formed about what is going on in the forest and surrounding area in
exchange for their lives. If a green dragon lives in a forest on a hillside, it will
seek to enslave hill giants, which the dragon considers its greatest enemy. A
green dragon makes its lair in underground chambers far beneath its forest.

The majority of green dragons encountered will be alone, However,
when a mated pair of dragons and their young are encountered, the fe-
male will leap to the attack. The male will take the young to a place of
safety before joining the fight. The parents are extremely protective of
their young, despite their evil nature, and will sacrifice their own lives to
save their offspring.

Ecology: Although green dragons have been known to eat practically
anything, including shrubs and small trees when they are hungry enough,
they especially prize elves. If the forest is on a hillside, hill giants hunt the
younger dragons, the meat of which they consider a delicacy.

Red dragons are the most covetous and greedy of all dragons, forever
seeking to increase their treasure hoards. They are obsessed with their
wealth and memorize an inventory accurate to the last copper. They are
exceptionally vain and self confident, considering themselves superior not
only to other dragons, but to all other life in general.

When red dragons hatch, their small scales are a bright glossy scarlet. Be-
cause of this, they can be quickly spotted by predators and men hunting for
skins, so they are hidden in deep underground lairs and not permitted to ven-
ture outside until toward the end of their young stage when their scales have
turned a deeper red, the glossy texture has been replaced by a smooth, dull fin-
ish, and they are more able to take care of themselves. As the dragon con-
tinues to age, the scales become large, thick, and as strong as metal.

Red dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all evil
dragons, and 16% of hatchling red dragons have an ability to communi-
cate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability in-
creases 5% per age category of the dragon.

Combat: Because red dragons are so confident, they never pause to ap-
praise an adversary. When they notice a target they make a snap decision
whether to attack, using one of many “perfect” strategies worked out
ahead of time in the solitude of their lairs. If the creature appears small
and insignificant, such as an unarmored man, the dragon will land to at-
tack with its claws and bite, not wanting to obliterate the creature with its
breath weapon, as any treasure might be consumed by the flames. How-
ever, if a red dragon encounters a group of armored men, it will use its
breath weapon, special abilities, and spells (if it is old enough to have
them) before landing.

Breath weapow/special abilities: 4 red dragon's breath weapon is a sear-
ing cone of fire 90’ long, 5' wide at the dragon’s mouth and 30’ at the base.

Creatures struck by the flames must save versus breath weapon for half
damage. Red dragons cast spells at 9th level, adjusted by their combat
modifiers,

Red dragons are born immune to fire. As they age, they gain the follow-
ing additional powers: Young: affect normal fires three times per day. Ju-
venile: pyrotechnics three times per day. Adult: heat metal once per day.
Old: suggestion once per day. Very old: hypnotism once per day. Venera-
ble: detect gems, kind and number in a 100' radius three times a day.

Habitat/Society: Red dragons can be found on great hills or on soaring
mountains. From a high perch they haughtily survey their territory, which
they consider to be everything that can be seen from their position. They
prefer to lair in large caves that extend deep into the earth.

Ared dragon enjoys its own company, not associating with other crea-
tures, or even other red dragons, unless the dragon's aims can be fur-
thered. For example, some red dragons who have charm spells will order
men to act as the dragon's eyes and ears, gathering information about
nearby settlements and sources of treasure. When a red dragons's off-
spring reach the young adult stage, they are ordered from the lair and the
surrounding territory, as they are viewed as competition.

Red dragons are quick to fight all creatures which encroach on their ter-
ritory, especially copper and silver dragons which sometimes share the
same environment. They hate gold dragons above all else because they
believe gold dragons are “nearly” as powerful as themselves.

Ecology: Red dragons are meat eaters, although they are capable of di-
gesting almost anything. Their favorite food is a maiden of any human or
demi-human race. Sometimes the dragons are able to charm key villagers
into regularly sacrificing maidens to them.

Silver dragons are kind and helpful. They will cheerfully assist good crea-
tures if their need is genuine. They often take the forms of kindly old men
or fair damsels when associating with people.

At birth, a silver dragon's scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As
the dragon approaches adulthood, its color slowly lightens to brightly
gleaming silver. An adult or older silver dragon has scales so fine that the
individual scales are scarcely visible. From a distance, these dragons look
as if they have been sculpted from pure metal.

Silver dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all good
dragons, and 16% of hatchling silver dragons have an ability to commu-
nicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability in-
creases 5% per age category of the dragon.

Combat: Silver dragons are not violent and avoid combat except when
faced with highly evil or aggressive foes. If necessary, they use feather fall
to stop any missiles fired at them. They use wall of fog or control weather
to blind or confuse opponents before making melee attacks. If angry, they
will use reverse gravity to fling enemies helplessly into the air, where they
can be snatched. When faced with flying opponents, a silver dragon will
hide in clouds (often creating some with control weather on clear days),
remain there using cloud walking, then jump to the attack when they have
the advantage.

Breath Weapon/Special Abilities: A silver dragon has two breath weap-
‘ons: a cone of cold 80' long, 5’ wide at the dragon's mouth, and 30’ wide at
the end or a cloud of paralyzation gas 50' long, 40' wide, and 20’ high.
Creatures caught in the gas must save versus breath weapon or become
paralyzed for one minute per age level of the dragon, plus 1-8 minutes.
Creatures caught in the cold are allowed a save versus breath weapon for
half damage. A silver dragon casts its spells and uses its magical abilities at

222221/2221 60% H, Rx3 20,000

6th level, plus its combat modifier.

At birth, silver dragons are immune to cold, and can polymorph self
three times a day. Each change in form lasts until the dragon chooses a dif-
ferent form and reverting to their normal form does not count as a change.
They also can cloud walk. This allows the dragon to tread on clouds or
fog as though they were solid ground. The ability functions continuously,
but can be negated or resumed at will. As they age, they gain the follow-
ing additional powers: Young: feather fall twice a day. Juvenile: wall of
fog once a day. Adult: control winds three times a day. Mature adult: con-
trol weather once a day. Old: reverse gravity once a day.

Habitat/Society: Silver dragons prefer aerial lairs on secluded mountain
peaks, or amid the clouds themselves. When they lair in clouds there al-
ways will be an enchanted area with a solid floor for laying eggs and stor-
ing treasure.

Silver dragons seem to prefer human form to their own, and often have
mortal companions. Frequently they share deep friendships with mortals.
Inevitably, however, the dragon reveals its true form and takes its leave to
live a dragon's life for a time.

Ecology: Silver dragons prefer human food, and can live on such fare in-
definitely.

Because they lair in similar territories, silver dragons come into conflict
with red dragons. Duels between the two species are furious and deadly,
but silver dragons generally get the upper hand since they are more capa-
ble of working together against their foes and often have human allies.

White dragons, the smallest and weakest of the evil dragons, are slow wit-
ted but efficient hunters. They are impulsive, vicious, and animalistic,
tending to consider only the needs and emotions of the moment and hav-
ing no foresight or regret. Despite their low intelligence, they are as
greedy and evil as the other evil dragons.

The scales of a hatchling white dragon are a mirror-like glistening
white, which makes them virtually invisible against a snowy background.
As the dragon ages, the sheen disappears, and by the time it reaches the
very old stage, scales of pale blue and light gray are mixed in with the
white.

White dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all evil
dragons, and 7% of hatchling white dragons have an ability to communi-
cate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability in-
creases 5% per age category of the dragon.

Combat: Regardless of a target's size, a white dragon's favorite method
of attack is to use its breath weapon and special abilities before closing to
melee, This tactic sometimes works to the dragon's detriment, as it can ex-
haust its breath weapon on smaller prey and then be faced with a larger
creature it must attack physically. If a white dragon is pursuing creatures
in the water, such as polar bears or seals, it will melee them in their ele-
ment, fighting with its claws and bite.

Breath weapon/special abilities: A white dragon's breath weapon is a
cone of frost 70’ long, 5‘ wide at the dragon’s mouth, and 25’ wide at the
base. Creatures caught in the blast may Save versus Breath Weapon for
half damage. A white dragon casts its spells and uses its magical abilities
at Sth level, plus its combat modifier.

From their birth, white dragons are immune to cold. As they grow
older, they gain the following additional abilities: Juvenile: ice walking,

which allows the dragon to walk across ice as easily as creatures walk
across flat, dry ground. Mature adult: gust of wind three times a day. Very
old: wall of fog three times a day, this produces snow or hail rather than
rain. Wyrm: freezing fog three times a day. This obscures vision in a 100’
radius and causes frost to form, creating a thin layer of glare ice on the
ground and on all surfaces within the radius.

Habitat/Society: White dragons live in chilly or cold regions, preferring
lands where the temperature rarely rises above freezing and ice and snow
always cover the ground. When temperatures become too warm, the
dragons become lethargic. White dragons bask in the frigid winds that
whip over the landscape, and they wallow and play in deep snow banks.

White dragons are lackadaisical parents. Although the young remain
with the parents from hatchling to juvenile or young adult stage, they are
not protected. Once a dragon passes from its hatchling stage, it must fend
for itself, learning how to hunt and defend itself by watching the parents.

White dragons’ lairs are usually icey caves and deep subterranean
chambers; they select caves that open away from the warming rays of the
sun. White dragons store all of their treasure within their lair, and prefer
keeping it in caverns coated in ice, which reflect the gems and coins and
make the treasure appear even larger. They are fond of gems, especially
diamonds, because they are pretty to look at.

Ecology: Although white dragons, as all other dragons, are able to eat
nearly anything, they are very particular and will consume only food
which has been frozen. Usually after a dragon has killed a creature with its
breath weapon it will fall to devouring it while the carcass is still stiff and
frigid. It will bury other kills in snow banks until they are suitably frozen.

White dragons’ natural enemies are frost giants who kill the dragons for
food and armor and subdue them to use for guards and mounts.

Dragon turtles are one of the most beautiful, awesome, and feared
creatures of the water. With their deadly jaws and breath weapon,
and their penchant for capsizing ships, dragon turtles are dreaded
by mariners on large bodies of water, both fresh and salt.

When a dragon turtle surfaces, it is sometimes mistaken for the
reflection of the sun or moon on the water. The turtle's rough,
deep green shell is much the same color as the deep water the
monster favors, and the silver highlights that line the shell are
patterned like light dancing on open water. The turtle’s legs and
tail are of a lighter green, and they are flecked with golden high-
lights. The coloration of the creature's head is similar to the legs
and tail, but its crest spines are golden with dark green webbing
connecting them. A dragon turtle’s shell can reach to 30 feet in di-
ameter, and an adult turtle can measure over 40 feet from its
snout to the tip of its tail. Dragon turtles speak their own highly-
developed language.

Combat: Though dragon turtles may be mistaken for the pleas-
ant sight of light glinting off of water, that illusion is never main-
tained for long. Dragon turtles are fierce fighters and will generally
attack any creature that threatens its territory or presents itself as a
potential meal. In combat, dragon turtles will usually (90%) attack
with their formidable claws and teeth first. Its shell provides the
turtle with excellent protection, though once the dragon turtle
strikes a victim, it rarely needs to rely upon this safeguard.

The dragon turtle's shell also provides the creature with a
weapon to attack ships that foolishly pass through its territory
uninvited. Sinking as deep as necessary, the dragon turtle will
wait for the ship to pass over it and then rise up underneath the
vessel, using all of its considerable bulk to capsize the unlucky
target. Ships under 20 feet in length will be capsized by this attack
95% of the time, vessels from 20 to 60 feet long will be capsized
50% of the time, and ships over 60 feet will be capsized 20% of
the time. Ships not capsized will sustain some damage.

In combat, when neither its bite nor its capsizing attack is
enough to defeat an enemy, a dragon turtle will use its breath
weapon. The turtle can belch forth a cloud of scalding steam that
will cover an area 60 feet long, 40 feet wide, and 40 feet high. This
attack causes 20-120 points of damage (20d6), and characters or

 

 

 

 

 

creatures making a saving throw versus breath weapon take half
damage. Like true dragons, dragon turtles can use this deadly
breath weapon three times a day.

Habitat/Society: Dragon turtles are extremely solitary crea-
tures. Large, desolate sea caves and secret underground caverns
that can be accessed only through the water are their favorite
lairs. These lairs are difficult to find, but adventurers locating a
dragon turtle’s cave will find it filled with treasures of all types.
The turtle gathers this treasure, which it will protect to the death,
from the ships sunk in its territory.

A dragon turtle's territory is well-defined and may cover as
much as fifty square miles of open water. Other dragon turtles are
allowed into this area only during mating season, though turtles
of the same sex will always fight to the death upon meeting. It is
this hostility toward their own kind that keeps the number of
dragon turtles relatively low.

Mariners of any experience recognize the territorial claims of
dragon turtles and will often make extravagant tributes to the tur-
tle controlling areas necessary for safe and speedy trade.

Ecology: Dragon turtles are carnivorous and will eat almost
any creature, including humans or other dragon turtles, to satisfy
their voracious appetite. Large fish seem to be the prefered food
for dragon turtles, and the turtles can often be found lurking in
the weeds and muck at the bottom of a lake or sea waiting for fish
to pass. In particularly poor years for fish, dragon turtles have
been known to use their breath weapon to kill large groups of sea
birds that stray too close to the water for food.

Conflict often arises between dragon turtles and the many in-
telligent aquatic races, like the locathah or mermen, because of
competition for ideal lairs. Like many of their land-based rela-
tives, dragon turtles are considered treacherous and selfish by all
creatures that share their domain.

Dragon turtle shells make outstanding shields and armor. Be-
cause of the shell’s strength and natural resistance to the dragon
turtle’s own breath weapon, armor or a shield made out of this
material gains +1 to its defensive rating. The shield or armor will
also save as an item against destruction by fire or steam-based at-
tacks at +4.

These shy, solitary scavengers are only interested in staying alive
and eating. Nevertheless, the two excellent self-defense methods
evolved in these creatures make them a potentially deadly enemy
for clumsy, inattentive adventurers.

Prefering to dwell in shallow freshwater pools or slow-moving
streams and rivers, dragonfish are flat and covered with thick,
hard scales of a mottled brown that give it a low Armor Class.
The fishes’ backs are lined with three to five rows of sharp, two-
inch-long spines. Together, the scales and spines make the fishes’
hides look much like that of a dragon. However, the dragonfish
shares little else with its terrifying namesake.

Combat: Dragonfish are extremely difficult to spot in their natu-
ral habitat. Their mottled brown coloration allows them to blend
in with the rocks and mud found at the bottom of the waters they
inhabit. Because their natural camouflage is so successful, dragon-
fish can be spotted only 15% of the time, and only if the searchers
know what they are looking for. Also, as dragonfish tend to be ac-
tive at night, finding one is always extremely difficult.

Most adventurers meet dragonfish inadvertently as they cross
the pools and streams where the fish reside. Dragonfish have
sharp teeth and will bite for 1-6 points of damage if they are pro-
voked. However, most adventurers literally stumble across the
creatures in the water. These encounters are always painful for
the unlucky wayfarer as the spines that line the fish’s back are
sharp enough to penetrate leather boots and will snap off, re-
maining in the wound as the fish and its attacker separate. A per-
son stepping on or attempting to grab a dragonfish will be struck
by 1-6 spines, each doing one point of damage.

The pain caused by the spines to anyone unlucky enough to
step on a dragonfish (or foolish enough to try to grab one) is cer-
tainly minor when compared to the deadly poison the spines in-
ject when they do any damage. This special poison is slow-acting,
and creatures injected with the toxin suffer increasingly violent
nausea and a high fever for four hours, and have a penalty of -1
onall attack rolls and saving throws for each hour of illness. (The
penalty is cumulative, so, for example, after four hours, a victim

__ of dragonfish poison will have a -4 penalty on all attack and sav-
ing throws.)

As these are the same symptoms that precede a death caused by
dragonfish poison, it will be unclear if a character will survive the

 

 

 

 

 

 

poisoning until the four hours of illness are over. Only after this
time has elapsed can a saving throw versus poison be made by the
victim (at a -4, like all saving throws after four hours). Those fail-
ing the saving throw die with 1-4 turns. But even for those who
save, the effects of the poison are long-lasting, and for the next
1d12 hours, a character surviving the poison will suffer a -2 pen-
alty on all attack rolls.

During the four hour onset time, a slow poison spell will stop
the penalties from adding up temporarily and, of course, a neu-
tralize poison will negate all effects of the toxin. Only one saving
throw against the poison is required, regardless of the number of
spines that strike the character at once.

Habitat/Society: Dragonfish tend to dwell near the bottom of
shallow bodies of water. Their diet consists largely of slow-
moving snails, small fish, and the remains of other creatures that
have recently died in the water. However, the dragonfish has been
known to eat almost anything it can swallow, including small bits
of metal such as coins or rings. The strong digestive acids in the
fish's stomach break down anything it swallows very quickly,
making it almost impossible to recover any undamaged treasure
from a dragonfish’s stomach.

The dragonfish is not territorial, but will protect a food source
it discovers. Dragonfish abandon their young at birth, and both
the male and female will prey upon any small dragonfish that
cross their path. This is one of the primary population controls on
the species.

Ecology: Intelligent races have discovered a large number of
uses for the dragonfish. Dragonfish poison is highly toxic and a
full-grown dragonfish can yield enough to kill a large number of
creatures. It is natural that creatures who frequently use poison
will have a standard method for capturing dragonfish. Also,
dragonfish spines make excellent darts, as they are extremely
strong and very sharp. (The spines also grow back on the fish, so
harvesting them is possible.) The dragonfish skin is not wasted ei-
ther, as it makes excellent material for scale armor. Using any part
of the dragonfish is potentially deadly unless the poison sacks and
spines are carefully removed first.

 
Elemental, Generic Information

 

 

Elementals are sentient beings that can possess bodies made of
one of the four basic elements that make up the Prime Material
Plane—air, earth, fire, or water. They normally reside on an ele-
mental Inner Plane and will only be encountered on the Prime
Material Plane if they are summoned by magical means. (See
Manual of the Planes for more information on the nature of the
various elemental planes.) Each elemental must adopt a shell in
the Prime Material composed of the basic element it represents.
and once this shell is destroyed, the elemental will return to its
native plane. While there are many more powerful and more in-
telligent residents of the elemental planes, the common elemen-
tal is the easiest to contact, and therefore the most frequently
summoned.

Their magical nature gives elementals great protection from at-
tacks on the Prime Material Plane. Elementals are not harmed by
any nonmagical weapons or magical weapons of less than +2 bo-
nus. Creatures with under four Hit Dice and without any magical
abilities cannot harm an elemental either. (Magical abilities in-
clude such characteristics as breath weapons, poisons, paralysis,
or even being immune to normal weapon attacks.) Orcs, for ex-
ample, are powerless against a conjured elemental unless one
happens to possess a weapon with +2 or better bonus to hit.

Though elementals do enjoy protection from many non-
magical attacks in the Prime Material Plane, like all extraplanar
and conjured creatures, elementals are affected by protection
from evil spells. An elemental cannot strike a creature protected
by this spell and must recoil from the spell’s boundaries. How-
ever, the elemental can attack creatures protected by the spell as
long as it doesn’t touch them. For example, a fire elemental could
set the ground on fire around the creature and wait for the blaze
to spread.

Each of the four types of common elemental has its own partic-
ular strengths and weaknesses, attack modes and method of
movement, depending on its plane of origin. These will be cov-
ered individually, by elemental type, in the next few pages. All
common elementals share one major characteristic, however.
They are basically stupid. This low intelligence makes it difficult
for the elemental to resist a magical summons. But even the com-
mon elemental is bright enough to know it does not like being
taken off of its home plane and held in the Prime Material Plane.

Summoning an Elemental: There are three basic ways to call an
elemental to this plane, and the strength of the conjured elemental
depends on the method used to summon it:

 
  
  

Conjured by spell ... . 8, 12, 16, or 21-24 Hit Dice
Conjured by staff . .- 16 Hit Dice
Conjured by summoning device . .. 12 Hit Dice

Obviously, the type of wizard or priest spell used to contact an
elemental will greatly effect the size of the creature on this plane.
(See Player's Handbook for specifics.) Also, a conjured elemen-
tal’s height (in feet) is equal to its Hit Dice, so the method of sum-
moning an elemental to the Prime Material Plane will also
determine its size.

Each individual's use of any spell, staff, or device in contacting
the elemental planes produces a unique call. This unique sum-
mons will only be answered by the inhabitants of a particular
plane once per day. Therefore, each of the methods of summon-
ing elementals—spell, device, and staff—can be used by one per-
son to call only one of any specific type of common elemental per
day. If a staff is used four times in one day, for example, all four
types of elementals must be called once.

The only exception to this is a character using more than one
method to call elementals. Then, the conjurer can call a number
of elementals of the same type equal to the number of methods
he or she uses. This means a person with a device and a staff can
summon two earth elementals. However, a person with two

staffs can still summon only one elemental of any specific type
in one day.

Controlling an Elemental: Because the elemental will be furious
at being summoned to this plane, concentration in conjuring the
creature is vital. In calling an elemental, a person must remain
perfectly still and focus all of his attention on controlling the be-
ing. Any distraction to the summoner, either mental or physical,
will result in a failure to control the elemental when it arrives on
the Prime Material Plane. Elementals that are uncontrolled and
acting upon their own desires are called free-willed. If the party is
lucky, a free-willed elemental will immediately return to its plane.
However, this occurs only 25% of the time.

In most cases (75% of the time), an uncontrolled elemental will
immediately attack the person or party who conjured it, also de-
stroying anything that stands between it and its enemies. There is
no way to gain control of the elemental once it is lost, and there is
nothing the objects of the elemental’s wrath can do but defend
themselves. The elemental’s intense dislike of being away from its
home plane is the only safeguard those conjuring an elemental
can rely upon if the elemental runs wild. Because remaining on
the Prime Material Plane is painful to any common elemental, the
uncontrolled elemental will always return to its plane of origin
three turns after control is lost, whether it has destroyed the crea-
tures responsible for calling it away from its elemental abode or
not.

There is always a 5% chance per round that an elemental is in
the Prime Material (beginning with the second round) that the
creature will break control and attack the person who summoned
it. Also, if a person is wounded, killed, or loses concentration
while controlling an elemental, the creature will become free-
willed. The elemental will first attack the person who summoned
it and then destroy any living thing it can find during the three
turns after control is lost. The creature will then return to its
home in the Inner Planes. A free-willed elemental can be sent to
its home plane if a dismissal spell is cast upon it, but there isonlya |
50% chance of success for the spell in this situation.

A successfully controlled elemental will stay on the Prime Ma-
terial only for the duration of the spell that summoned it, and it
can be controlled from a distance up to 30 yards per level of the
person who summoned it. If under control, an elemental can be
dismissed by the summoner when its task is complete.

Stealing Control of an Elemental: Control of a conjured elemen-
tal can be stolen from the person who summoned it by casting dis-
pel magic specifically at the magical control over the creature (not
the elemental itself or the person controlling it). Most of the nor-
mal rules for dispelling magic apply (Player's Handbook p. 148).
However, when dealing with control over an elemental, a roll of
20 by the person attempting the spell means that all control has
been dispelled and the creature is now free-willed.

If control of the elemental is stolen, the creature will follow the
wishes of the new person controlling it as if he or she summoned it
in the first place. If the dispel magic fails, the elemental will imme-
diately be strengthened to its maximum 8 hit points per die and
the conjurer’s ability to control the elemental will be greatly en-
hanced, making any new attempts to steal control of the creature
impossible. Also, the elemental will recognize the person who
sought to take control of its will as a threat. If the person cur-
rently guiding the creature loses control, the elemental will imme-
diately attack the person who attempted to steal control of its
will—even before attacking the person who first summoned it.

Air elementals can be conjured in any area of open air where gusts
of wind are present. The common air elemental appears as an
amorphous, shifting cloud when it answers its summons to the
Prime Material Plane. They rarely speak, but their language can
be heard in the high-pitched shriek of a tornado or the low moan
of a midnight storm.

Combat: While air elementals are not readily tangible to the in-
habitants of planes other than its own, they can strike an oppo-
nent with a strong, focused blast of air that, like a giant, invisible
fist, does 2-20 points of damage. The extremely rapid rate at
which these creatures can move make them very useful on vast
battlefields or in extended aerial combat. In fact, the air elemen-
tal’s mastery of its natural element gives it a strong advantage in
combat above the ground. In aerial battles, they gain a +1 to hit
and a +4 to the damage they inflict.

The most feared power of an air elemental is its ability to form
a whirlwind upon command. Using this form, the air elemental
appears as a truncated, reversed cone with a 10 foot bottom di-
ameter and 30 foot top diameter. The height of the whirlwind de-
pends on the Hit Dice of the elemental. An air elemental of 8 Hit
Dice will produce a whirlwind standing 40 feet tall; a 12 Hit Dice
elemental produces a whirlwind standing 60 feet tall; and a 16 Hit
Dice elemental produces a whirlwind standing 80 feet tall. It takes
one full turn to form and dissipate this cone.

This whirlwind lasts for one melee round, sweeps away and
kills all creatures under three Hit Dice in the area of its cone, and
does 2-16 points of damage to all creatures it fails to kill outright.
If, because of overhead obstructions, the whirlwind fails to reach
its full height, it can only sweep up creatures under two Hit Dice
and do 1-8 points of damage to all others in its cone.

Earth elementals can be conjured in any area of earth or stone.

This type of common elemental appears on the Prime Material
Plane as a very large humanoid made of whatever types of dirt,
stones, precious metals, and gems it was conjured from. It has a
cold, expressionless face, and its two eyes sparkle like brilliant,
multifaceted gems. Though it has a mouth-like opening in its
face, an earth elemental will rarely speak. Their voices can be
heard in the silence of deep tunnels, the rumblings of earth-
quakes, and the grinding of stone on stone.

Though earth elementals travel very slowly, they are relentless
in the fulfillment of their appointed tasks. An earth elemental can
travel through solid ground or stone with no penalty to move-
ment or dexterity. However, these elementals cannot travel
through water: they must either go around the body of water in
their path or go under it, traveling in the ground. Earth elemen-
tals prefer the latter as it keeps them moving, more or less, in a
straight line toward their goal.

Combat: Earth elementals will always try to fight on the ground
and will only rarely be tricked into giving up that advantage. Be-
cause of their close alliance to the rock and earth, these elementals
do 4-32 points of damage (4d8) whenever they strike a creature
that rests on the ground.

Against constructions with foundations in earth or stone, earth
elementals do great damage, making them extremely useful for
armies sieging a fortification. For example, a reinforced door,
which might require a few rounds to shatter using conventional
methods, can be smashed with ease by an earth elemental. They
can even level a small cottage in a few rounds.

An earth elemental's effectiveness against creatures in the air or
water is limited; the damage done by the elemental's fists on air-
borne or waterborne targets is lessened by 2 points per die (to a
minimum of 1 point of damage per die).

Fire elementals can be conjured in any area containing a large
open flame. To provide a fire elemental with an adequate shell of
Prime Material flame, a fire built to house an elemental should
have a diameter of at least six feet and reach a minimum of four
feet into the air.

On the Prime Material plane, a fire elemental appears as a tall
sheet of flame. The fire elemental will always appear to have two
armlike appendages, one on each side of its body. These arms
seem to flicker back into the creature's flaming body, only to
spring out from its sides seconds later. The only facial features of
a fire elemental are two large glowing patches of brilliant blue
fire, which seem to function as eyes for the elemental. Like all
common elementals, fire elementals rarely speak on the Prime
Material Plane, though their voices can be heard in the crackle
and hiss of a large fire.

Combat: Because they resent being conjured to this plane, fire
elementals are fierce opponents who will attack their enemies di-
rectly and savagely, taking what joy they can in burning the weak
creatures and objects of the Prime Material to ashes. In combat, a
fire elemental lashes out with one of its ever-moving limbs, doing
3-24 points of damage. Any flammable object struck by the fire
elemental must save versus magical fire at a -2 or immediately be-
gin to burn.

Fire elementals do have some limitations on their actions in the
Prime Material Plane. They are unable to cross water or non-
flammable liquids. Often, a quick dive into a nearby lake or stream
is the only thing that can save a powerful party from certain death
from a fire elemental. Also, because their natural abilities give
them some built-in resistance to flame-based attacks, creatures
with innate fire-using abilities, like red dragons, take less damage
from a fire elemental’s attack. The elemental subtracts 1 point from
each die of damage it does to these creature (to a minimum of 1
point of damage per die).

16 Hit Dice: 10,000

Water elementals can be conjured in any area containing a large
amount of water or watery liquid. At least one thousand cubic
feet of liquid is required to create a shell for the water elemental to
inhabit. Usually a large pool serves this purpose, but several large
kegs of wine or ale will do just as well.

The water elemental appears on the Prime Material Plane as a
high-crested wave. The elemental’s arms appear as smaller
waves, one thrust out on each side of its main body. The arms ebb
and flow, growing longer or shorter as the elemental moves. Two
orbs of deep green peer out of the front of the wave and serve the
elemental as eyes. Like all other common elementals, water ele-
mental rarely speak on the Prime Material Plane, but their voices
can be heard in the crashing of waves on rocky shores and the
howl of an ocean gale.

Combat: In combat, the water elemental is a dangerous adver-
sary. It prefers to fight in a large body of water where it can con-
stantly disappear beneath the waves and suddenly swell up
behind its opponent. When the elemental strikes, it lashes out
with a huge wave-like arm, doing 5-30 points of damage.

Water elementals are also a serious threat to ships that cross
their path. A water elemental can easily overturn small craft (one
ton of ship per hit die of the elemental) and stop or slow almost
any vessel (one ton of ship per hit point of the elemental). Ships
not completely stopped by an elemental will be slowed by a per-
centage equal to the ratio of ship’s tons over the hit points of the
attacking elemental.

Though the water elemental is most effective in large areas of
open water, it can be called upon to serve in a battle on dry land,
close to the body of water from which it arose. However, the
movement of the water elemental on land is the most restricted of
any elemental type: a water elemental cannot move more than 60
yards away from the water it was conjured from, and 1 point of
damage is subtracted from each die of damage they inflict out of
the water (to a minimum of 1 point of damage per die).

Elephants have thick,
baggy hides, covered
with sparse and very
coarse tufts of gray
hair. The elephant's
most renowned feature
is its trunk, which it
uses as a grasping limb.

Combat: An ele-
phant can make up to
five attacks at one
time in a battle. It can
do stabbing damage
of 2-16 points (248)
with each of its two
tusks; constricting
damage of 2-12 points
with its trunk; and 2-
12 points of trampling damage with each of its front feet. No sin-
gle opponent can be subject to more than two of these attacks at
any one time. However, the elephant can battle up to six man-
sized opponents at one time.

Creatures larger than ogre-sized are not subject to the ele-
phant's trunk attack. Also, an elephant will never attempt to
grasp anything that might harm its trunk—like an object covered
with sharp spikes. Elephants greatly fear fire.

 

 

 

 

Habitat/Society: Elephants are peaceful herbivores that travel
ina herd. The herd is made up of both male and female elephants,
as well as their young. If a herd of ten or more elephants is en-
countered, there will be 1-4 young, from 20% to 70% mature,
with the group. In the herd, a clear hierarchy exists, with the
older males in a clear position of dominance.

Occasionally, an older male elephant will be beaten by a rival
in the herd. The defeated elephant must then leave the group, at

10+5 Hit Dice: 4,000

which point it becomes a violent “rogue.” Rogue elephants en-
countered alone are 90% likely to attack, and will have no fewer
than six hit points per hit die.

Ecology: Elephants are commonly captured when young and
trained. They make good beasts of burden, but are often used in
warfare as mounts and living battering rams, as well.

Elephant tusks are worth 100 to 600 hundred gold pieces each,
or about 4 gp per pound. In areas heavily populated by elephants,
a substantial trade in this ivory will be common.

Mammoths: This ancestor of the elephant was common during
the Pleistocene era, Mammoths are covered with thicker, woolier
hair than the modern elephant, and they are considerably larger.
Mammoths are much more aggressive than elephants and will at-
tack with less provocation. Because they are heavier, a mam-
moth’s tusks are worth 50% more than an elephant's. Mammoths
are rare when encountered outside of a Pleistocene campaign,
and will only be found in subarctic plains.

Mastodons: Like the mammoth, the mastodon is an ancestor of
the elephant that was common in the Pleistocene era, when they
roamed from subarctic to tropical plains. They are larger than the
modern elephant, hairier, and somewhat greater in length. En-
countered outside of a Pleistocene campaign, mastodons are rare,
and found only in subarctic plains.

Oliphants: The oliphant is a modern-day mastadon, with
shaggy hair and tusks that curve down. The oliphant's trunk is
too short to be used in combat. This limits the number of man-
sized opponents an oliphant can attack at one time to four. Oli-
phants are more intelligent than elephants and do not share its
cousin's unreasoning fear of fire. They are also very aggressive,
and when properly trained and fed, oliphants grow to greater
bulk (10 +5 Hit Dice) than their wild counterparts. These trained
oliphants are excellent for combat duty and have a morale of 10.
An oliphant’s tusks are worth 100 to 400 gold pieces each, or
about 4 gp per pound, but are smaller than an elephants.

Though their lives span several human generations, elves appear
at first glance to be frail when compared to man. However, elves
have a number of special talents that more than make up for their
slightly weaker constitutions.

High elves, the most common type of elf, are somewhat shorter
than men, never growing much over than 5 feet tall. Male elves
usually weigh between 90 and 120 pounds, and female elves only
weigh between 70 and 100 pounds. High elves are dark-haired,
and their eyes are always a beautiful, deep shade of green—and
have infravision up to 60 feet. The features of an elf are delicate
and finely chiseled.

Elves are very pale of complexion, which is odd because they
spend a great deal of time outdoors. They also tend to be slim,
looking almost fragile. Both their pale complexion and slight
build are the results of a constitution that is weaker than man’s.
Elves, therefore, always subtract one point from their initial Con-
stitution ability score. Though they are not as sturdy as humans,
elves are much more agile, and they always add one point to their
initial Dexterity ability score.

Elvish clothing tends to be colorful, but not garish. They often
wear pastel colors, especially blues and greens. Because they
dwell in forests, however, high elves will often wear greenish-
grey cloaks to afford them quick camouflage.

Elves have learned that it is very important to understand the
creatures—both good and evil—that share their forest home. Be-
cause of this, elves may speak the tongue of goblins, orcs, hob-
goblins, gnolls, gnomes, and halflings, in addition to common
and their own highly-developed language. They will always
show an interest in anything that will allow them to communicate
with, and learn from, their forest-dwelling neighbors.

Combat: Elves are cautious fighters and will always use their
strengths to an advantage if possible. One of the greatest strengths
elves have is their ability to pass through natural surroundings,
such as a wood or forest, silently and almost invisibly. By moving
quietly and blending into the vegetation for cover, elves can often
surprise a person or party (opponents have a surprise modifier of
-5). Also, as long as they are not attacking, the elves hiding in the
forest can only be spotted by someone or something with the abil-
ity to see invisible objects. The military value of this skill is im-
mense, and elven armies will always send scouts to spy on the
enemy, since such spies are rarely caught—or even seen.

 

 

 

 

 

Although their constitutions are weak, elves have extremely
strong wills. Elves have such strong wills, in fact, that they are
90% immune to all charm and sleep spells. And even if their natu-
ral resistance to these spells fails, they get a normal saving
throw—making it unlikely an elf will fall victim to these spells
very often.

Elves live in the wild, so weapons are used for everything from
dealing with the hostile creatures that live around their camps, to
such mundane tasks as hunting dinner. The elves’ rigorous train-
ing with bows and swords, in addition to their great dexterity,
gives them a natural bonus of +1 to hit when fighting with a
short or long sword, or using a bow of any kind other than a
crossbow. Elves are especially proficient in the use of the bow.
Because of their agility, elves can move, fire a bow, then move
again, all in the same round, making their archers extremely mo-
bile, and therefore dangerous.

Because of horses’ limitations in forest combat, elves do not fa-
vor their use. Elves prefer to fight as foot soldiers and are generally
armed as such. Most elves wear scale, ring, or chain mail, and al-
most all high elves carry shields. And although elves have natural
bonuses when they use bows and swords, their bands carry a vari-
ety of weapons. The composition of a band of elves by weaponry
is: spear—30% ; sword—20% ; sword and spear—20% ; sword and
bow—10%; bow—15%; two-handed sword—5%.

Elvish fighters and multi-class fighters have a 10% chance per
level to possess a magical item of use to his or her class. This per-
centage is cumulative and can be applied to each major type of
magical item that character could possibly use—for each class in
the case of multi-class characters. (For example, a fighter/priest
of level 4/5 would have a 40% chance to have a magical item use-
ful to fighters and a 50% chance of having an item useful to
priests.) In addition, if above 4th level, elvish mages gain the
same percentage chance to gain items, but gain 2-5 magical items
useful to them if a successful roll is made.

For every twenty elves in a group, there will be one 2nd or 3rd
level fighter (50% chance of either). For every forty elves in a
group, in addition to the group’s higher level fighter, there will be
a 1st or 2nd level mage (again, 50% chance of either). If one hun-
dred or more elves are encountered, the following additional fig-
ures will be present: a 4th level fighter/8th level mage; two 4th

 
 

Elf

level fighter/5th level mage; and a 4th level fighter/4th level
mage/4th level thief. Finally, if over one hundred and sixty elves
are encountered, they will be lead by a 6th level fighter/9th level
mage, and a 6th level fighter/6th level mage/6th level thief. These
two extremely powerful leaders will have two retainers each—a
4th level fighter/Sth level mage, and a 3rd level fighter/3rd level
mage/3rd level thief. All of these higher level leaders are added
to, not taken from the total number of elves encountered.

Elven women are the equal of their male counterparts in all as-
pects of warfare. In fact, some bands of elves will contain units of
female fighters, who will be mounted on unicorns. This occurs
rarely (5% chance), and only 10-30 elf maidens will be encoun-
tered in such a unit. However, legends of the destruction wrought
by these elven women are common among the enemies of the
elves.

Habitat/Society: Elves value their individual freedom highly, so
their social structure is based on independent bands, These small
groups of no more than two hundred recognize the authority of a
royal overlord, who in turn owes allegiance to a king or queen.
However, the laws and restraints set upon elven society are very
few compared to human society and practically negligible when
compared to dwarven society,

Elven camps are always well-hidden and well-protected. In ad-
dition to a large number of observation posts and personnel traps
set around the camp, high elves typically set 2-12 giant eagles as
guardians of their lairs (65% of the time). For every forty elves
encountered in a camp, there will be the following high-level
elves, as well as the leaders noted above: a 4th level fighter, a 4th
level cleric, and a 2nd level fighter/2nd level mage/2nd level
thief. In addition a 4th level fighter/7th level mage, a Sth level
fighter, a 6th level fighter, and a 7th level cleric will be present. Fe-
males found in a camp will equal 100%, and children will equal
50% of the males encountered.

Because elves remain in the world about 350 years (of their
twelve hundred year life span), their view of the world is radically
different from most other sentient beings. Their long lifespan
means that elves do not place much importance on short-term
gains or hurry to finish projects. Humans see this attitude as friv-
olous; the elves simply find it hard to understand why everyone
else is always in such a rush.

Elves prefer to surround themselves with things that can bring
them joy for a long period of time—things like music and nature.
The company of others of their own race is also very important to
elves, as they find it hard to share their experiences or their per-
spective on the world with other races. This is one of the main
reasons elven families are so close. However, even friends of
other races are kept forever by an elf, as friendship, too, is some-
thing very worthwhile.

Though they are immune to a few specific spells, elves are en-
thralled by magic for most of their lives. Not a specific spell, of
course, but the idea of magic. Cooperation is far more likely pur-
chased from an elf with an obscure, even practically worthless,
but interesting magical item, then it is with two sacks of gold.

Ultimately, their radically different perspective separates the
elves from the rest of their world. Elves find dwarves far too dour
and find their adherence to strict codes of law unpleasant. How-
ever, elves do recognize dwarven craftsmanship as something to
be lauded. Elves think a bit more highly of humans, though they
see man’s race after wealth and fleeting power as rather sad. In the
end, all elves leave the world they share with dwarves and men,
and journey to a mysterious land where they can live freely for
the rest of their many days.

Ecology: Elves produce fine clothes, beautiful music, and bril-
liant poems. It is for these that cultures outside of elven society
know the folk of the forest best. In their world within the forest,

however, elves keep the forces of evil—creatures like orcs that
would plunder the forest and then move on—from causing too
much damage. For this alone, elves are irreplacable.

Grey Elves (Faerie)

Unlike high elves, grey elves have either silver hair and amber
eyes, or pale golden hair and violet eyes (the latter are known as
faerie elves). They favor bright garments of white, gold, silver, or
yellow, and wear cloaks of deep blue or purple. The grey elves are
the rarest group of elves, and they have little to do with the world
outside of their forests. They value intelligence very highly, and,
unlike other elves, devote much time to study and contemplation.
Their treatises on nature are astounding.

Grey elves value their independence from what they see as the
corrupting influence of the outside world, and will fight fiercely
to maintain that isolation. All grey elves carry swords, and most
wear chain mail and carry a shield. For mounts, grey elves will
ride hippogriffs (70% ) or griffons (30%). Those that ride griffons
will have 3-12 griffons for guards at their camps instead of giant
eagles.

Wood Elves

Also called sylvan elves, wood elves are the wild branch of the elf
family. Wood elves are slightly darker in complexion than high
elves. Their hair is yellow to coppery-red, and their eyes are light
brown, light green, or hazel. They wear clothes of dark browns
and greens, tans and russets, in order to blend in with their sur-
roundings. Wood elves are very independent and value strength
over intelligence. They will avoid contact with strangers 75% of
the time.

In battle, wood elves wear studded leather or ring mail, and
50% of their band will be equipped with bows. Only 20% of
wood elves carry swords, and only 40% use spears. Wood elves
prefer to ambush their enemies, using their ability to hide in the
forest until their foes are close at hand. In most cases (70%),
wood elf camps are guarded by 2-8 giant owls (80%) or by 1-6 gi-
ant lynx (20%). These elves speak only elvish and the languages
of some forest animals and the treant. Wood elves are more in-
clined toward the tenets of neutrality rather than good, and are
not above killing people who stumble across their camps, in order
to keep their location secret.

Half-Elves

Half-elves are always of human stock, and have features of both
the elven and human parent. They are slightly taller than the
common elf, growing as tall as 5!/2 feet and weighing up to 150
pounds. Though they do not gain the natural sword or bow bo-
nus from their elven relatives, they do have normal infravision.

A half-elf can travel freely between most elvish and human
settlements, though occasionally prejudice will be a problem. The
half-elf's lifespan is the biggst source of grief, however. As a half-
elf lives more than 125 years, he or she will outlive any human
friends or relatives, but grow old too quickly to be a real part of
elven society. Many half-elves deal with this by traveling fre-
quently between the two societies, enjoying life as it comes and
taking the best of both worlds. Half-elves may speak common,
elf, gnome, halfling, goblin, hobgoblin, orc, and gnoll.

The three varieties of genie described here come from the elemen-
tal planes of Air, Earth, and Fire. Living there, among their own
kind, they are organized into their own societies. These beings are
sometimes encountered on the Prime Material plane and are often
summoned specifically to perform some service for a powerful
wizard or priest. All genies can travel to any of the elemental
planes, as well as the Prime Material and Astral planes.

All genies can speak their own tongue and that of any intelli-
gent being they meet through a limited form of telepathy.

Djinn

The djinn are genies from the elemental plane of Air. It should be
noted that “djinn” is the plural form of their name while “djinni” is
the singular.

Combat: The djinn's magical properties enable them to do any
of the following once per day: create nutritious food for 2-12
(2d6) persons, create water or wine for 2-12 (2d6) persons, create
soft goods or wooden items (up to about 16 cubic feet of the
former or 9 cubic feet of the latter) with permanence, create metal
items of short life span (the harder the metal the less time it lasts;
gold has about a 24 hour existence while djinni steel lasts only 1
hour) of up to about 100 pounds weight, create illusion with both
visual and audio components which will last without concentra-
tion until magically dispelled or touched, become invisible, as-
sume gaseous form, wind walk, or form a whirlwind.

A djinni whirlwind is cone-shaped and may be up to 10’ across
at its base, 30’ across at its mouth, and 70’ high (according to the
desire of the djinni). It requires one full turn to form the whirl-
wind and one full turn for it to dissolve. The whirlwind lasts one
melee round. Non-aerial creature of less than two Hit Dice are
swept away and killed by the whirlwind while hardier beings take
2-12 (2d6) points of damage. Creatures or attacks based on ele-
mental air suffer a -1 penalty on their attack and damage rolls
when engaging the djinni.

Djinn are nearly impossible to capture by physical means, es-
pecially when they are able to take flight and employ their whirl-
winds. They are openly contemptuous of those life forms which
need wings or artificial means to fly and will employ their illusion

and invisiblity powers to great effect against such foes. Thus, the
capture and enslavement of djinn is better resolved by the referee
on a case by case basis. It is worth noting, however, that a good
master will typically encourage a djinni to additional effort and
higher performance, while a demanding and cruel master encour-
ages the opposite.

Djinn are able to carry up to 600 pounds of weight, both afoot
and flying, without tiring. They can carry double that weight for
a short time—three turns if afoot but only one turn if flying. For
each 100 pounds less than maximum add one turn to the time
which a djinni may walk or fly before tiring. A djinni which is
thus fatigued must rest for six turns before attempting further
strenuous activity.

Habitat/Society: A djinn landhold on the plane of Air is usually
set upon a pocket of elemental earth anywhere from 1,000 yards
to several miles across. It is crammed with buildings, courtyards,
gardens, fountains, and sculptures made of elemental flames. Ina
typical djinn landhold there are 3-30 (3d10) djinn of various ages
and powers, as well as 1-10 jann and 1-10 elemental creatures of
low intelligence. All are ruled by a djinn of maximum hit points,
the local sheik.

The social structure of Djinn society is based on rule by a caliph
served by various nobles and officials (viziers, beys, emirs,
sheiks, sherrifs, and maliks). A caliph rules all those djinn estates
within two days’ travel, and is advised by six viziers who help
maintain the balance of the landholdings.

If a landhold is attacked by a large force, a messenger (usually
the youngest djinni) is sent to the next landhold, which then sends
aid and dispatches two more messengers, and in this fashion the
entire nation is warned.

Noble Djinn

Some djinn (1%) are “noble” and are able to grant three wishes
to their masters. Noble djinn will do no other services and, upon
granting the third wish they are freed of their servitude. Noble
djinn are as strong as the efreet, have 10 hit dice, strike for 3-24
(3d8) points of damage, and their whirlwinds cause 3-18 (3d6) hit
points of damage.

 
Genie

Dao

A dao is a genie from the elemental plane of Earth. While they are
generally found on that plane (though even there they are uncom-
mon), the dao love to come to the Prime Material plane to work
evil. Dao speak all the languages of geniekind, as well as man’s
common language and the tongue of earth elementals.

Combat: The dao’s magical abilities enable them to use any of
the following spell-like powers, one at a time, once each per day:
change self, detect good, detect magic, assume gaseous form, be-
come invisible, fulfill another's limited wish (in a perverse way),
cause misdirection, passwall, create a spectral force, and create a
wall of stone. Dao can turn rock to mud three times per day and
dig as often as six times per day. Dao perform all magic at the 18th
level of spell use.

It is possible for a dao to carry up to 500 pounds without tiring.
Double weight will cause tiring in three turns, but for every 100
pounds of weight under 1,000 the dao may add one turn to the
duration of its carrying ability. For example, a 600 pound weight
allows eight turns of either walking or flying. After tiring, a dao
must rest for six turns. Note that dao can move through earth (not
worked stone) at a burrowing speed of 6. They cannot take living
beings with them, but can safely carry inanimate objects.

Dao are not harmed by earth-based/affecting spells, but holy
water has double normal effects upon these monsters.

Habitat/Society: The dao dwell in the Great Dismal Delve on
their own plane and in deep caves, caverns, or cysts on the Prime
Material plane. Like other genies, the dao tend to settle pockets of
other elemental matter, bending it to their wills and desires. A
dao mazework contains 4-40 (4d10) of the creatures, as well as
twice that number of elemental and non-elemental slaves. Each
mazework is ruled by an ataman or hetman who acts on advice
from a seneschal. The loyalty of the ataman of a dao mazework
to the Great Dismal Delve is always questionable, but the sene-
schals are always chosen by the khan of the dao, and their loyalty
is to him alone.

The khan of the dao lives at the center of the great underground
mazework called the Great Dismal Delve. The land within the
delve is said to be larger than most Prime Material continents.
The Great Dismal Delve is linked to all manner of elemental
pockets, so that the khan can call forth whatever powers he
needs. The population of dao in the delve is unknown, as is the
number of slaves that continually work the tunnels and clear
away damage from quakes which frequently shake it.

Dao dislike servitude as much as efreet and are even more
prone to malice and revenge than their fiery counterparts.

Ecology: The dao manage a thriving business of trade, driven
by their desire for more power and their access to precious gems.
High on their list of hatreds are most other genies (except efreet,
with whom they trade worked metals for minerals). Slightly less
hated are other elemental creatures, whom dao value only if they
can exploit them in some fashion.

Efreet

The efreet (singular: efreeti) are genies from the elemental plane
of Fire. They are enemies of the djinn and will always attack when
they encounter them. A properly summoned or captured efreeti
can be forced to serve for a maximum of 1,001 days or can be
made to fulfill three wishes. They are not willing servants, and
they will seek to pervert the intent of their masters by adhering to
the letter of their commands.

The efreet are said to be made of basalt, bronze, and solid
flames, but whatever their makeup, they are massive, solid crea-
tures.

Combat: An efreeti is able to do the following once per day:
grant up to three wishes, become invisible, assume gaseous form,
detect magic, enlarge (as a 10th-level wizard), polymorph self,
create an illusion with both visual and audio components which
will last without concentration until magically dispelled or
touched, or create a wall of fire. An efreeti can also produce flame
or cause pyrotechnics as often as desired. Attacks based on fire do
no harm to efreet if the fire is of the “normal” sort and even magi-
cal fire suffers a -1 penalty on all attack and damage rolls.

Efreet can carry up to 750 pounds, afoot or flying, without tir-
ing. They can carry double weight for only a limited time—three
turns afoot or one turn aloft. For each 150 pounds of weight un-
der 1500 add one turn to either walking or flying time permitted.
After tiring from extreme weight the efreeti must rest for six full
turns.

Habitat/Society: Efreet are infamous for their dislike of servi-
tude, their desire for revenge, their cruel nature, and their ability
to mislead. The efreet’s chief home is their great citadel, the fabled
City of Brass, but there are numerous other efreet-operated out-
posts throughout the plane of Fire.

An efreet outpost is a haven for 4-40 (4d10) efreet and is run as
a military station to watch or harass other movement in the
plane. These outposts are run by a malik or vali of maximum nor-
mal hit points. There is a 10% chance that the outpost will also be
providing a temporary home for 1-4 jann or 1-4 dao (the only
other types of geniekind the efreet tolerate). Outpost forces are
primarily directed against incursions from the plane of elemental
Air, but can be directed against any travelers deemed suitable for
threats, robbery, and abuse.

Efreet are neutral, but they tend toward organization and evil
or selfish acts in their behavior. They are ruled by a grand sultan
who makes his home in the City of Brass. He is advised by a vari-
ety of beys, amirs, and maliks on actions with the plane, and by
six great pashas who deal with matters of efreet business on the
Prime Material plane.

The City of Brass is a huge citadel that is home to the majority
of efreet. It hovers in the hot regions of the plane and is often bor-
dered by seas of para-elemental magma and lakes of glowing
lava. The city itself sits upon a hemisphere of golden, glowing
brass some 40 miles across. From the upper towers rise the mina-
rets of the great citadel of the Sultan's Palace. Vast riches are said
to be in the palace of the sultan. The city has an efreet population
that far outnumbers the great cities of the Prime plane. The sultan
wields the might of a Greater Power, while many of his advisors
are akin to Lesser Powers and Demi-Powers.

Ecology: Fire elementals tend to avoid the efreet, whom they
feel are oppressive and opportunistic. Djinn hate them, and there
have been numerous djinn-efreet invasions of each other's planes.
Efreet view most other creatures either as enemies or servants, a
view that does not endear them to the rest of geniekind.

Ghosts are the spirits of humans who were either so greatly evil in
life or whose deaths were so unusually emotional they have been
cursed with the gift of undead status. Thus, they roam about at
night or in places of darkness. These spirits hate goodness and
life, hungering to draw the living essences from the living.

Combat: As ghosts are non-corporeal (ethereal), they are usu-
ally encountered only by creatures in a like state, although they
can be seen by non-ethereal creatures. The supernatural power of
a ghost is such, however, that the mere sight of one causes any hu-
manoid being to age 10 years and flee in panic for 2-12 (2d6) turns
unless a saving throw versus spells is made. Priests above 6th
level are immune to this effect and all other humanoids above 8th
level may add +2 to their saving throws.

Any creatures within 60 yards of a ghost is subject to attack by
a magic jar. If the ghost fails to magic jar its chosen victim, it
will then semi-materialize in order to attack by touch (in which
case the ghost is Armor Class 0). Semi-materialized ghosts can be
struck only by silver (half damage) or magical weapons (full dam-
age). If they strike an opponent it ages him 10-40 (1d4x10) years.
Note that ghosts can be attacked with spells only by creatures
who are in an ethereal state. Any human or demi-human killed by
a ghost is drained of its life essence and is forever dead.

If the ghost fails to become semi-material it can only be com-
batted by another in the Ethereal plane (in which case the ghost
has an Armor Class of 8).

Ghosts can be turned by clerics after reaching 7th level and can
be damaged by holy water while in their semi-material form.

Habitat/Society: In most cases, a ghost is confined to a small
physical area, which the ghost haunts. Those who have heard
stories of a haunted area can thus attempt to avoid it for their
own safety.

A ghost often has a specific purpose in its haunting, sometimes
trying to “get even” for something that happened during the
ghost's life. Thus a woman who was jilted by a lover, and then
committed suicide, might become a ghost and haunt the couple's
secret trysting place. Similarly, a man who failed at business
might appear each night at his storefront or, perhaps, at that of a
former competitor.

Another common reason for an individual to become a ghost is
the denial of a proper burial. A ghost might inhabit the area near
its body, waiting for a passerby to promise to bury the remains.

 

 

 

 

The ghost, in its resentment toward all life, becomes an evil crea-
ture intent on destruction and suffering.

In rare circumstances, more than one ghost will haunt the same
location. The classic example of this is the haunted ship, a vessel
lost at sea, now ethereal and crewed entirely by ghosts. These
ships are most often encountered in the presence of St. Elmo's fire,
an electrical discharge that causes mysterious lights to appear in
the rigging of a ship.

In many cases, a ghost can be overcome by those who might be
no match for it in combat simply by setting right whatever events
led to the attainment of the ghost's undead status. For example, a
young woman who was betrayed and murdered by someone who
pretended to love her might be freed from her curse if the cad
were humiliated and ruined. In many cases, however, a ghost's re-
venge will be far more demanding, often ending in the death of
the offender.

Ecology: The dreadful fear caused by the ghost, which ages a
victim 10 years, is not well understood by the common man, who
often ascribes it to the fact that a ghost is “dead.” If this were the
case, then certainly skeletons and zombies would have the same
effect, which they do not.

Common folklore further confuses this fact by relating details
of the ghost’s physical form: the classic example of which is the
headless horseman, thought by many to be particularly frighten-
ing simply because he had no head. Under this belief, one could
face a ghost if only one had the courage to stand up to him. Sucha
mistaken impression has cost many lives over the years. Actually,
the fear is caused by the supernatural power of the ghost, and has
nothing whatsoever to do with courage.

Ghouls are undead creatures, once human, who now feed on the
flesh of corpses. Although the change from human to ghoul has
deranged and destroyed their minds, ghouls have a terrible cun-
ning which enables them to hunt their prey most effectively.

Ghouls are vaguely recognizable as once having been human,
but have become horribly disfigured by their change to ghouls.
The tongue becomes long and tough for licking marrow from
cracked bones, the teeth become sharp and elongated, and the
nails grow strong and sharp like claws.

Combat: Ghouls attack by clawing with their filthy nails and biting
with their fangs. Their touch causes humans (including dwarves,
gnomes, half-elves, and halflings, but excluding elves) to become
rigid unless a saving throw versus paralyzation is successful. This pa-
ralysis lasts for 3-8 (2+1d6) rounds or until negated by a priest.

Any human or demi-human (except elves) killed by a ghoulish
attack will become a ghoul unless blessed (or blessed and then res-
urrected). Obviously, this is also avoided if the victim is devoured
by the ghouls. Ghoul packs always attack without fear.

These creatures are subject to all attack forms except sleep and
charm spells. They can be turned by priests of any level, The
magic circle of protection from evil actually keeps ghouls com-
pletely at bay.

Habitat/Society: Ghouls and ghasts are most frequently en-
countered around graveyards, where they can find plenty of
corpses on which to feed.

Ecology: Ghouls (and ghasts, as described later) delight in re-
volting and loathsome things—from which we draw our adjec-
tives “ghoulish” and “ghastly.”

Lacedon

The lacedon is a marine form of the ghoul. Lacedons are some-
times found near marine ghosts, particularly ghost ships. Lace-
dons are less common than ghouls because of the fewer corpses
available for them to feed on, but they can often be found swarm-
ing around recent shipwrecks in rivers, lakes, and oceans.

Ghast

These creatures are so like ghouls as to be completely indistin-
guishable from them, and they are usually found only with a pack
of ghouls. When a pack of ghouls and ghasts attacks it will
quickly become evident that ghasts are present, for they exude a
carrion stench in a 10’ radius which causes retching and nausea
unless a saving throw versus poison is made. Those failing to
make this save will attack at a penalty of -2.

Worse, the ghast shares the ghoulish ability to paralyzation,
and their attack is so potent that it will even affect elves, Paralysis
caused by a ghast lasts for 5-10 (4 +1d6) rounds or until negated
by a priest's remove paralysis spell.

Ghasts, like ghouls, are undead class and thus sleep and charm
spells do not affect them. Though they can be struck by any sort of
weapon, cold iron inflicts double normal damage. Clerics can turn
them beginning at 2nd level. The circle of protection from evil does
not keep them at bay unless it is used in conjunction with cold iron
(such as a circle of powdered iron or an iron ring).

Cloud giants consider themselves above all other giants, save
storm giants, whom they consider equals. They are creative, ap-
preciate fine things, and are master strategists in battle.

Cloud giants have muscular human builds and handsome,
well-defined features, The typical cloud giant is 24’ tall and
weighs 11,500 pounds. Female cloud giants can be one to two feet
shorter and 1,000 to 2,000 pounds lighter. Cloud giants’ skin
ranges in color from a milky-white tinged with blue to a light sky
blue. Their hair is silvery white or brass and their eyes are an iri-
descent blue. Cloud giants can live to be 400 years old.

A cloud giant's natural Armor Class is 0. Although they will
wear no armor, these giants prize magical protection devices, and
one in 20 will have such a device. Cloud giants dress in clothing
made of the finest materials available and wear jewelry. Many of
the giants consider their appearance an indication of their station;
the more jewelry and the better the clothes, the more important
the giant. Cloud giants also appreciate music, and the majority of
giants are able to play one or more instruments (their favorite is
the harp). Unlike most other giant races, cloud giants leave their
treasure in their lairs, carrying with them only food, throwing
rocks, 10-100 (10d10) coins, and a musical instrument.

Cloud giants speak their own tongue and the language of all
other giants. In addition, 60% of all cloud giants speak common.

Combat; Cloud giants fight in well-organized units, using care-
fully developed battle plans. They prefer to fight from a position
above their opponents. A favorite tactic is to circle the enemy,
barraging them with rocks while the giants with magical abilities
assault them with spells. Cloud giants can hurl rocks to a maxi-
mum of 240 yards, causing 2-24 (2d12) points of damage. Their
huge morningstars do 6-24 (6d4) +11 points of damage, three
times normal (man-sized) damage plus their strength bonus. One
in 10 cloud giants will have a magical weapon.

 

 

 

 

 

Habitat/Society: Cloud giants live in small clans of no more
than six giants. However, these clans know the location of 1-8
other clans and will band together with some of these clans for
celebrations, battles, or to trade. These joined clans will recog-
nize one among them to be their leader—this is usually an older
cloud giant who has magical abilities. One in 10 cloud giants will
have spells equivalent to a 4th level wizard, and one in 20 cloud
giants will be the equivalent of a 4th level priest. A cloud giant
cannot have both priest and wizard abilities.

If encountered in a lair, half will be immature giants. To deter-
mine a giant's maturity, roll 1d4. A roll of 4 indicates an infant
with no combat ability and hit points of ogre. Rolls of 1-3 indicate
older progeny with hit dice, damage, and “to hit” rolls equal to
that of a fire giant.

The majority of cloud giants live on cloud-covered mountain
peaks in temperate and sub-tropical areas. These giants make
their lairs in crude castles. Only 10% of good cloud giants live in
castles on enchanted clouds. All giants dwelling there are able to
levitate their own weight plus 2,000 pounds three times a day, cre-
ate a fog cloud three times a day, and create a wall of fog once a
day. These abilities are performed as a 6th level wizard.

There is a 60% chance a cloud giant mountain lair will be
guarded by 1-4 spotted lions, 2-5 (1d4+1) owl bears, or 2-5
(1d4 +1) griffons (1-2 wyverns for evil cloud giants). In addition,
there is a 50% chance the lairs of evil cloud giants will contain 1-
20 human and demi-human slaves. There is an 80% chance that a
cloud island lair will be guarded by 2-5 (1d4+1) griffons, 2-8
(2d4) hippogriffs, or 2-5 (1d4 +1) giant eagles.

Cloud lairs are fantastic places with giant-sized gardens of fruit
trees. According to legend, some giants mine their cloud islands
for small chunks of the purest silver.

Ecology: Cloud giants prefer food that is carefully prepared
with spices and sauces, and they relish fine, aged wines.

Good cloud giants trade with human and demi-human com-
munities for food, wine, jewelry, and cloth. Some cloud giant
clans will establish good relations with such communities, and
will come to the communities’ aid if they are endangered. Evil
cloud giants raid human and demi-human communities to get
what they want.

Fire giants are brutal, ruthless, and militaristic.

They are tall, but squat, resembling huge dwarves. An adult
male is 18’ tall, has a 12' chest, and weighs about 7,500 pounds.
Fire giants have coal black skin, flaming red or bright orange hair,
and prognathous jaws that reveal dirty ivory or yellow teeth.
They can live to be 350 years old.

A fire giant's natural Armor Class is 5. Warriors usually wear
banded mail and round metal helmets (AC -1). They carry their
belongings in huge sacks. A typical fire giant's sack contains 2-5
(1d4 +1) throwing rocks, the giant's wealth, a tinderbox, and 3-12
(3d4) common items. Everything they own is battered, filthy, and
smelly, making it difficult to identify valuable items.

All fire giants can speak the language of all giants and their own
tongue.

Combat: Fire giants are immune to nonmagical fire and heat, as
well as red dragon breath. They are resistant to all types of magi-
cal fire; such attacks inflict -1 hit point per die of damage. Adult
fire giants can hurl rocks for 2-20 (2d10) points of damage. Their
minimum range is 3 yards while their maximum is 200 yards.
They can catch similar large missiles 50% of the time. They usu-
ally fight in disciplined groups, throwing rocks until they run out
of ammunition or the opponent closes. Fire giants often wait in
ambush at lava pools or hot springs, hurling heated rocks at vic-
tims for an extra 1-6 points of damage.

Warriors favor huge two-handed swords. A fire giant's over-
sized weapons do double normal (man-sized) damage to all oppo-
nents, plus the giant's strength bonus. Thus, a fire giant
two-handed sword does 2-20 (2d10) +10 points of damage.

Habitat/Society: Fire giants live in well organized military
groups, occupying large castles or caverns. When encountered in
their lair there will be 13-20 (1d8 +12) giants, half of whom will
be immature giants. To determine a giant's maturity, roll 1d4. A

 

 

 

 

 

roll of 4 indicates an infant with no combat ability and hit points
of an ogre while rolls of 1-3 indicate older progeny with hit dice,
damage, and attack rolls equal to that of a frost giant.

Their lairs are always protected by vigilant watchmen, and
sometimes by traps. Fire giants favor deadfalls that can crush in-
truders for 5-30 (5d6) points of damage, and large crossbow de-
vices that fire one, two, or three huge bolts for 2-16 (2d8) points
of damage each.

Particularly intelligent fire giant leaders will command groups
three or four times normal size. One who commands 30 or more
giants usually will call himself a king. Kings always will have bet-
ter than normal armor and a magical weapon of +1 to +3.

There is a 20% chance that any band of fire giants will have a
shaman (80%) or witch doctor (20%). If the group is lead by a
king, there is an 80% chance of a spell caster. Fire giant shamans
are priests of up to 7th level. A shaman can cast normal or re-
versed spells from the Elemental, Healing, Charm, Protection,
Divination, or Combat spheres. Fire giant witch doctors are
priest/wizards of up to 7th/3rd level; they prefer spells that can
detect or thwart intruders.

Fire giants often capture and tame other creatures as guards.
There is a 50% chance that a fire giant lair will contain 1-4 hell
hounds. Larger than normal groups check once for every 10 gi-
ants. Bands with 30 or more giants have a additional 30% chance
to have 2-5 (1d4 +1) trolls, larger groups check once for every 20
giants. A king’s group has a 20% chance to have 1-2 red dragons
of age category 2-5 (1d4 +1) in addition to other guards. Fire gi-
ants frequently take captives to hold for ransom or use as slaves.
There is a 25% chance that a lair will contain 1-2 captives, larger
bands check once per 10 giants.

Ecology: Fire giants live wherever there is a lot of heat. They
prefer volcanic regions or areas with hot springs. Frequently they
share their lairs with other fire-dwelling creatures such as sala-
manders or fire elementals.

Fire giants prefer to eat meat and bread, they can hunt and kill
their own meat, but raid human and demi-human settlements for
grain, captives, and treasure.

Like all evil giants, frost giants have a reputation for crudeness
and stupidity. This reputation is deserved, but frost giants are
crafty fighters.

Frost giants have muscular, roughly human builds. The typical
adult male is 21’ tall and weighs about 8,000 pounds, Females are
slightly shorter and lighter, but otherwise identical to males. Frost
giants have snow-white or ivory skin. Their hair is light blue or
dirty yellow, with matching eyes. They can live to be 250 years
old.

A frost giant's natural Armor Class is 5. Warriors usually wear
chain mail and metal helmets decorated with horns or feathers
(AC 0). They also wear skins and pelts, along with any jewelry
they own.

Frost giants carry their belongings in huge sacks. A typical
frost giant's sack contains 2-5 (1d4 +1) throwing rocks, the giant's
wealth, and 3-12 (3d4) mundane items. Everything in a giant's
bag is old, worn, dirty, and smelly, making the identification of
any valuable items difficult.

Frost giants speak their own language and the language com-
mon to all giants.

Combat: Frost giants are immune to cold. Adult frost giants can
hurl rocks for 2-20 (2d10) points of damage. Their minimum
range is 3 yards while their maximum is 200 yards. They can
catch similar large missiles 40% of the time. They usually will
start combat at a distance, throwing rocks until they run out of
ammunition, or the opponent closes. One of their favorite strate-
gies is to ambush victims by hiding buried in the snow at the top
of an icy or snowy slope where opponents will have difficulty
reaching them.

Warriors favor huge battle axes. A frost giant's oversized weap-
ons do double normal (man-sized) damage to all opponents, plus
the giant's strength bonus. Thus, a frost giant battle axe does 2-16
(2d8) +9 points of damage.

 

 

 

 

 

Habitat/Society: Frost giants live in small bands consisting of a
chief, his henchmen, and their camp followers. A band usually
will occupy a crude castle or frigid cavern. When encountered in
their lair there will be 9-16 1d8 +8) giants; half of whom will be
immature. To determine a giant's maturity, roll 1d4. A roll of 4 in-
dicates an infant with no combat ability and hit points of ogre;
rolls of 1-3 indicate older progeny with hit dice, damage, and at-
tack rolls equal to that of a stone giant.

Particularly strong or intelligent frost giant chieftains will com-
mand bands three or four times normal size. A chieftain who
commands 20 or more giants is called a jarl. Jarls always will have
better than normal armor and a weapon of +1 to +3 enchant-
ment.

There is a 20% chance that any band of frost giants will have a
shaman (80%) or witch doctor (20%). If the group is lead by a
jarl, there is an 80% chance for a spell caster. Frost giant shamans
are priests of up to 7th level. A shaman can cast normal or re-
versed spells from the healing, charm, protection, divination, or
weather spheres. Frost giant witch doctors are priest/wizards of
up to 7th/3rd level; they prefer spells that can bewilder and con-
found other giants. Favorite spells include: unseen servant,
shocking grasp, detect magic, ventriloquism, deeppockets, ESP.
mirror image, and invisibility.

Frost giants often capture and tame other creatures as guards.
There is a 50% chance that a frost giant lair will contain 1-6 win-
ter wolves. Larger than normal groups check once for every eight
giants. Bands with 20 or more giants have a additional 30%
chance to have 1-4 yeti, larger groups check once for every 16 gi-
ants. A jarl’s band has a 20% chance to have 1-2 subdued white
dragons in addition to other guards. The dragons will be age cate-
gory 2-5 (1d4 +1). Frost giants also take captives to hold for ran-
som or use as slaves. There is a 15% chance that a lair will contain
1-2 captives, larger bands check once per eight giants. Captives
can be of any race.

Ecology: Frost giants live in frigid, arctic lands with glaciers and
heavy snowfall. Frost giants eat mostly meat, which they can
hunt and kill themselves. They raid human and demi-human
settlements for foodstuffs and other booty.

Hill giants are selfish, cunning brutes who survive through hunt-
ing and by terrorizing and raiding nearby communities. Despite
their low intelligence, they are capable fighters.

Hill giants are oddly simian and barbaric in appearance, with
overly long arms, stooped shoulders, and low foreheads. Even
though they are the smallest of the giants, their limbs are more
muscular and massive than those of the other giant races. The av-
erage hill giant is 16 feet tall and weighs about 4,500 pounds. Fe-
males have the same builds as males. Their skin color ranges from
a light tan to a deep ruddy brown. Their hair is brown or black,
and their eyes are black. Hill giants can live to be 200 years old.

Hill giants’ natural Armor Class is 5. This is reduced to an Ar-
mor Class of 3 when they wear crudely-sewn animal hides, which
are the equivalent of leather armor. Nearly all hill giants wear
these hides, which are a symbol of esteem in some hill giant
communities—the more hides a giant has, the more large kills to
his credit. Only a few (5%) of the giants fashion metal armor
from the armor of men they have defeated. These giants have an
Armor Class of 0. Like other races of giants, hill giants carry their
belongings with them in huge hide sacks. A typical hill giant's bag
will contain 2-8 (2d4) throwing rocks, the giant's wealth, and 1-8
additional common items.

Hill giants speak their own language and a tongue common to
all giants. In addition, 50% also speak ogre.

Combat: Hill giants prefer to fight their opponents from high
rocky outcroppings where they can pelt their targets with rocks
and boulders while limiting the risks posed to themselves.

Hill giants’ favorite weapons are oversized clubs which do 2-12
+7 points of damage (double the damage of a man-sized club plus
their strength bonus). They hurl rocks for 2-16 (2d8) points of
damage. Their targets for such attacks must be between 3 and 200
yards away from the giant. They can catch rocks or other similar
missiles 30% of the time.

Habitat/Society: A hill giant lair will have 9-16 (1d8 +8) giants;
usually an extended family. Sometimes these families will accept
lone hill giants into their folds. If six or more giants are encoun-
tered in a lair, half of them will be male, one quarter will be fe-

 

  

 
   
 

 

 

 

 

male, and the remainder will be immature giants. To determine a
giant's maturity, roll 1d4. A roll of 4 indicates an infant with no
combat ability and hit points of gnoll; rolls of 1-3 indicate older
progeny with hit dice, damage, and attack rolls equal to that of an
ogre.

Occasionally a hill giant with an average intelligence can be
found. Such a giant is capable of rallying bands of his peers so 2,
3, or 4 times the number of giants usually appearing can be en-
countered. These “giant kings,’ as they call themselves, stage
raids on human towns or against other races of giants.

Although hill giants prefer temperate areas, they can be found
in practically any climate where there is an abundance of hills and
mountains. They lair in caves, excavated dens, or crude huts.
Those who live in colder climates have developed more skills
with preparing and using skins to keep themselves warm and to
keep the harsh winds out of their lairs.

There is a 50% chance a band of hill giants will have guards in
their lairs, and the guarding creatures will be 2-8 (2d4) dire
wolves (50%), 1-3 giant lizards (30%), or a group of 2-8 (2d4)
ogres (20%).

The majority of hill giants are suspicious of magic and will seek
to destroy magic items they acquire as treasure. They ceremoni-
ally kill mages.

Ecology: Hill giants’ main diet consists of meat, which they ob-
tain by hunting. The flesh of young green dragons is considered a
delicacy, and frequently giants who live on hills and mountains
covered with forests will organize hunting parties in search of
green dragon lairs. In turn, green dragons have been known to
hunt hill giants.

Sometimes bands of hill giants will trade with each other or
with bands of ogres to get foodstuffs and trinkets.

Stone giants are lean, but muscular. Their hard, hairless flesh is
smooth and gray, making it easy for them to blend in with their
mountainous surroundings. Their gaunt facial features and deep,
sunken black eyes make them seem perpetually grim.

The typical stone giant is 18’ tall and weighs 9,000 pounds be-
cause of its dense flesh. Females are a little shorter and lighter.
The giants’ natural Armor Class is 0. They do not wear armor to
augment that, preferring to wear stone-colored garments. Stone
giants can live to be 800 years old.

Stone giants, like several other giant races, carry some of their
belongings with them. They leave their more valuable items in
their lairs, however. A typical stone giant's bag will contain 2-24
(2d12) throwing rocks, a portion of the giant's wealth, and 1-8 ad-
ditional common items.

Stone giants speak their own language, as well as those of hill
giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. In addition, 50% of the gi-
ants also speak the common language of man.

Combat: When possible, stone giants fight from a distance.
They are able to hurl rocks a minimum distance of 3 yards to a
maximum distance of 300 yards, doing 3-30 (3d10) points of dam-
age with each rock. These giants are able to catch stones and simi-
lar missiles 90% of the time. A favorite tactic of stone giants is to
stand nearly motionless against rocks, blending in with the back-
ground, then moving forward to throw rocks, surprising their
foes. Many giants set up piles of rocks near their lair which can be
triggered like an avalanche when intruders get too close.

When stone giants are forced into melee combat, they use large
clubs chiseled out of stone which do 2-12 (2d6) +8 points of dam-
age; double normal (man-sized) club damage plus the giant's
strength bonus.

Habitat/Society: Stone giants prefer to dwell in deep caves high
on rocky, storm-swept mountains. They normally live in the
company of their relatives, though such a clans usually include
no more than 10 giants. Clans of giants do locate their lairs near

 

 

 

 

 

 

each other, however, for a sense of community and protection. A
mountain range commonly has 2-8 clans lairing there.

Stone giants are crude artists, painting scenes of their lives on
the walls of their lairs and on tanned hide scrolls. Some giants are
fond of music and play stone flutes and drums. Others make sim-
ple jewelry, fashioning painted stone beads into necklaces.

If eight or more giants are encountered in a clan’s lair, one quar-
ter will be female, one quarter male, and the remainder offspring.
To determine a giant's maturity, roll 1d4. A roll of 4 indicates an
infant with no combat ability and hit points of an ogre; rolls of 1-
3 indicate older progeny with hit dice, damage, and attack rolls
equal to those of a hill giant.

One in 20 stone giants develop special abilities related to their
environment. These giant elders are able to stone shape, stone
tell, and transmute rock to mud (or mud to rock) once per day as
if they were Sth level mages. One in 10 of these exceptional giants
can also cast spells as if he were a 3rd level wizard. Their spells
can be determined randomly or chosen to fit a specific encounter
as desired. Frequently these giants are able to rise to positions of
power and are considered the leaders of several clans.

Stone giants are usually found in mountain ranges in temperate
and sub-tropical areas. Stone giants are fond of cave bears and
75% of their lairs will have 1-8 of them as guards. The few stone
giants living in cold areas use polar bears as guards.

Stone giants are playful, especially at night. They are fond of
rock throwing contests and other games that test their might.
Tribes of giants will often gather to toss rocks at each other, the
losing side being the giants who are hit more often.

Ecology: Stone giants are omnivorous, but they will eat only
fresh food. They cook and eat their meat quickly after it has been
killed. They use the skins of the animals for blankets and trade
what they do not need with nearby human communities in ex-
change for bolts of cloth or herd animals which they use for food.
Many stone giant bands keep giant goats in and near their lairs so
they will have a continuous supply of milk, cheese, and butter.

Storm giants are gentle and reclusive, They are usually tolerant of
others, but can be very dangerous when angry.

Storm giants resemble well-formed humans of gargantuan pro-
portions. Adult males and females are about 26’ tall and weigh
about 15,000 pounds, Storm giants have pale, light green or
(rarely) violet skin. Green-skinned storm giants have dark green
hair and glittering emerald eyes. Violet-skinned storm giants
have deep violet or blue-black hair with silvery gray or purple
eyes. Storm giants can live to be 600 years old.

Astorm giant's garb usually is a short, loose tunic belted at the
waist, sandals or bare feet, and a headband. They wear a few
pieces of simple, but finely crafted jewelry: anklets (favored by
bare-footed giants), rings, or circlets being most common.

Storm giants usually carry pouches attached to their belts.
These hold only a few tools, necessities, and a simple musical
instrument—usually a panpipe or harp. Other than the jewelry
they wear, they prefer to leave their wealth in their lairs.

They speak their own language as well as cloud giant, the tongue
common to all giants, and the common tongue of humankind.

Combat: All storm giants are immune to electricity and light-
ning. They use weapons and special abilities instead of hurling
rocks, but can catch large missiles 65% of the time.

Storm giants are born with water breathing ability, and can
move, attack, and use magic under water as if they were on land.
Juvenile and adult storm giants can cast control weather and levi-
tate spells lifting their own weight and as much as 4,000 addi-
tional pounds twice a day. Adult storm giants also can predict
weather, call lightning (3 bolts of 15 8-sided dice each), lightning
bolt (1 bolt of 15 6-sided dice), control winds, and use weather
summoning once a day. A storm giant uses its magical abilities at
15th level. An angry storm giant usually will summon a storm
and call lightning.

They employ gigantic two-handed swords in battle. A storm
giant's oversized weapons do triple normal (man-sized) damage

 

 

 

 

 

to all opponents, plus the giant's strength bonus. Thus, a storm
giant's two-handed sword does 3-30 (3d10) +12 points of dam-
age. They also use massive composite bows which have a 300
yard range and do 3-18 (3d6) points of damage. There is a 10%
chance that any storm giant will have enchanted weapons.

Astorm giant's natural Armor Class is 0, In battle, storm giants
usually wear elaborate bronze plate mail (AC -6).

Habitat/Society: Storm giants are retiring and solitary, but not
shy, They live in castles built on cloud islands (60%), mountain
peaks (20%), or underwater (10%). They live quiet, reflective
lives and spend their time musing about the world, composing
and playing music, and tilling their land or gathering food. Land-
and air-dwelling storm giants usually are on good terms with
neighboring silver dragons and good cloud giants, and cooperate
with them for mutual defense. Aquatic storm giants have similar
relationships with mermen and bronze dragons.

When two or more storm giants are encountered in lair they
will be a mated couple and their children. To determine each
young giant's maturity, roll 1d4. A roll of 4 indicates an infant
with no combat ability and hit points of ogre; rolls of 1-3 indicate
older progeny with hit dice, damage, and attack rolls equal to
that of a cloud giant.

There is a 20% chance that an adult storm giant is also a priest
(70%) or priest/wizard (30%). Storm giants can attain 9th level
as priests and 7th level as wizards. Storm giant priests can cast
regular spells from the Animal, Charm, Combat, Creation,
Guardian, Healing, Plant, Weather, and Sun spheres. Storm giant
wizards are generalists, and typically know spells from the Alter-
ation, Invocation/Evocation, Conjuration/Summoning, and
Abjuration schools,

Storm giant lairs are always protected by guards. Land or aer-
ial lairs have 1-2 rocs (70%), which also serve a mounts, or 1-4
griffons (30%). Underwater lairs have 2-8 (2d4) sea lions.

Ecology: Storm giants live off the land in the immediate vicinity
of their lairs. If the natural harvest is not enough to sustain them,
they create and carefully till large areas of gardens, fields, and
vineyards. They do not keep animals for food, preferring to hunt.

Gnolls are large, evil, hyena-like humanoids that roam about in
loosely organized bands.

While the body of a gnoll is shaped like that of a large human,
the details are those of a hyena. They stand erect on two legs and
have hands that can manipulate as well as those of any human.
They have greenish gray skin, darker near the muzzle, with a
short reddish gray to dull yellow mane.

Gnolls have their own language and many also speak the
tongues of flinds, trolls, orcs, or hobgoblins.

Combat: Gnolls seek to overwhelm their opponents by sheer
numbers, using horde tactics. When under the direction of flinds
or a strong leader, they can be made to hold rank and fight as a
unit. While they do not often lay traps, they will ambush or at-
tempt to attack froma flank or rear position. Gnolls favor swords
(15%), pole arms (35%) and battle axes (20%) in combat, but
also use bows (15%), morningstars (15%).

Habitat/Society: Gnolls are most often encountered under-
ground or inside abandoned ruins. When above ground they op-
erate primarily at night. Gnoll society is ruled by the strongest,
using fear and intimidation. When found underground, they will
have (30% chance) 1-3 trolls as guards and servants. Above
ground they keep pets (65% of the time) such as 4-16 hyenas
(80%) or 2-12 hyaenodons (20%) which can act as guards.

A gnoll lair will contain between 20 and 200 adult males. For
every 20 gnolls, there will be a 3 hit die leader. If 100 or more are
encountered there will also be a chieftain who has 4 hit dice, an
Armor Class of 3, and who receives a +3 on his damage rolls due
to his great strength. Further, each chieftain will be protected by
2-12 (2d6) elite warrior guards of 3 Hit Dice (AC 4, +2 damage).

In a lair, there will be females equal to half the number of
males. Females are equal to males in combat, though not usually
as well armed or armored. There will also be twice as many
young as there are adults in the lair, but they do not fight. Gnolls
always have at least 1 slave for every 10 adults in the lair, and
may have many more.

 

 

 

 

 

Gnolls will work together with orcs, hobgoblins, bugbears,
ogres, and trolls. If encountered as a group, there must be a rela-
tive equality of strength. Otherwise the gnolls will kill and eat
their partners (hunger comes before friendship or fear) or be
killed and eaten by them. They dislike goblins, kobolds, giants,
humans, demi-humans and any type of manual labor.

Ecology: Gnolls eat anything warm blooded, favoring intelli-
gent creatures over animals because they scream better. They will
completely hunt out an area before moving on. It may take sev-
eral years for the game to return. When allowed to die of old age,
the typical gnoll lives to be about 35 years old.

Flind

The flind is similar to a gnoll in body style, though it is a little
shorter, and broader. They are more muscular than their cousins.
Short, dirty, brown and red fur covers their body. Their fore-
heads do not slope back as far, and their ears are rounded, but still
animal like.

Flinds use clubs (75%) which inflict 1-6 points of damage and
flindbars (25%) which do 1-4 points of damage. A flindbar is a
pair of chain-linked iron bars which are spun at great speed. A
flind with a flindbar can strike twice per round. Each successful
hit requires the victim to save versus wands or have his weapon
entangled in the chain and torn from his grasp by the flindbar.
Due to their great strength, flinds get a +1 on their attack rolls.

Flinds are regarded with reverence and awe by gnolls. Flind
leaders are 3 +3 hit dice, at least 13 intelligence and 18 charisma
to gnolls (15 to flinds), and always use flindbars.

Smaller relatives of the dwarves, gnomes are shy and rarely seen
by other demi-humans. They tend to dwell near secluded forests,
and live peaceful lives.

Short and stout, the gnome looks like a compact version of the
dwarf, although two major facial features help to distinguish
them. Gnomes do not let their beards grow longer than half a
foot, and they have long, broad noses fully twice the size of any
dwarf's. The skin of a gnome is any shade of wooden brown,
sometimes with a hint of gray. Their hair is white, and their eyes
are shades of blue. Gnomish clothing tends toward leather and
earth tones, with jewelry to match.

Gnomes speak their own language and are often able to con-
verse with kobolds, goblins, halflings,and dwarves. Further,
many are able to communicate with burrowing mammals via a
basic language of signs and animal sounds.

Combat: Gnomesare likely to use any strategy in combat that is
not blatantly treacherous. Their great hatred of kobolds and gob-
lins gives them a +1 on their attack rolls when fighting them. All
giant class creatures (gnolls, bugbears, ogres, trolls, giants, etc.)
must subtract 4 from their attack rolls when fighting gnomes.

Gnomes can use any weapon that matches their size, and al-
ways carry a second (or even third) weapon. They are fond of
studded leather armor and small shields (AC 6). Their leaders will
have chain mail (AC 4) and any gnome above Sth level has plate
mail (AC 2). There is a 10% chance for each level above Sth that
the gnome's armor or weapon is magical (roll separately for
each). Roll percentile dice two or three times (DM's discretion) on
the table below to determine their weapons.

Club (or war hammer) 01-40%
Short sword 41-70%
Spear 71-85%
Short bow (or crossbow) 86-90%
Sling 91-95%
Dagger 96-00%

Gnomes are highly resistant to magic or poison and save as if
they were 4 levels higher than they really are. Gnomes can be
priests or fighters, but prefer being thieves and illusionists. Spell

"casters have a 10% chance per level of having 1-3 magical items
_ (not weapons or armor) usable by their character class.

 

 

 

 

 

Habitat/Society: Gnomes live in underground burrows in re-
mote woods. They are clannish, with a friendly rivalry between
nearby clans. They spend their lives mining, tunneling and enjoy-
ing the peaceful quiet of the woods. Gnomes work hard, and play
hard. They observe many festivals and holidays, which usually
involve games and swapping of grand tales. Their society is well
organized, with many levels of responsibility, culminating in a
single chief. The clerics share leadership with the chief, but only
for those matters directly relating to their calling. Internal strife in
a gnome tribe is uncommon, although not unheard of.

A gnomish lair will be home to some 40-400 (4d10x10) adult
males. For every 40 gnomes there is a fighter of 2nd to 4th level
(1d3 +1). If 160 or more are encountered there is also a Sth level
chief and a 3rd level lieutenant. If 200 or more are met, there is a
cleric or illusionist of 4th to 6th level (d3 +3). If 320 or more are
met, add a 6th level fighter, 2 Sth level fighters, a 7th level cleric, 4
3rd level clerics, a Sth level illusionist and 2 2nd level illusionists.

Also in the lair, there will be a number of females equal to the
number of males and children equal to '/a the total number of
adults. Gnomes use animals to guard their homes, 5-30 (5d6)
badgers (70%), 3-12 (3d4) giant badgers (20%), or 2-8 (2d4) wol-
verines (10%). These creatures are not bound or caged, but are
free creatures that have chosen to stay near the tribe.

Ecology: Gnomes are very much a magical part of nature, exist-

ing in harmony with the land they inhabit. They choose to live
underground for protection and to avoid marring the works of
nature. Gnomes eat meat only if no other food source is availa-
ble. They have an average life span of around 600 years and are
capable of detecting slopes and other underground constructions
as described in the Player's Handbook.

These small, evil humanoids would be merely pests, if not for
their great numbers.

Goblins have flat faces, broad noses, pointed ears, wide
mouths and small, sharp fangs. Their foreheads slope back, and
their eyes are usually dull and glazed. They always walk upright,
but their arms hang down almost to their knees. Their skin colors
range from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red.
Usually a single tribe has members all of about the same color
skin. Their eyes vary from bright red to a gleaming lemon yellow.
They wear clothing of dark leather, tending toward dull soiled-
looking colors.

Goblin speech is harsh, and pitched higher than that of hu-
mans. In addition to their own language, some goblins can speak
in the kobold, orc, and hobgoblin tongues.

Combat: Goblins hate bright sunlight, and fight with a -1 on
their attack rolls when in it. this unusual sensitivity to light, how-
ever, serves the goblins well underground, giving them infra-
vision out to 60 feet. They can use any sort of weapon, preferring
those that take little training, like spears and maces. They are
known to carry short swords as a second weapon. They are usu-
ally armored in leather, although the leaders may have chain or
even plate mail.

Goblin strategies and tactics are simple and crude. They are
cowardly and will usually avoid a face-to-face fight. More often
than not, they will attempt to arrange an ambush of their foes.

Habitat/Society: Humans would consider the caves and under-
ground dwellings of goblins to be dank and dismal. Those few
tribes that live above ground are found in ruins, and are only ac-
tive at night or on very dark, cloudy days. They use no form of
sanitation, and their lairs have a foul stench. Goblins seem to be
somewhat resistant to the diseases that breed in such filth.

They live a communal life, sharing large common areas for eat-
ing and sleeping. Only leaders have separate living spaces. All
their possessions are carried with them. Property of the tribe is
kept with the chief and sub-chiefs. Most of their goods are stolen,
although they do manufacture their own garments and leather
goods. The concept of privacy is largely foreign to goblins.

A typical goblin tribe has 40-400 (4d10 x 10) adult male war-
riors. For every 40 goblins there will be a leader and his 4 assist-
ants, each having 1 hit die (7 hit points). For every 200 goblins

      

 

 

 

 

there will be a sub-chief and 2-8 (2d4) bodyguards, each of which
has 1 +1 Hit Dice (8 hit points), is Armor Class 5, and armed with
a battle axe. The tribe has a single goblin chief and 2-8 (2d4)
bodyguards each of 2 Hit Dice, Armor Class 4, and armed with
two weapons.

There is a 25% chance that 10% of their force will be mounted
upon huge worgs, and have another 10-40 (1d4x10) unmounted
worgs with them. There is a 60% chance that the lair is guarded
by 5-30 (Sd6) such wolves, and a 20% chance of 2-12 (2d6) bug-
bears. Goblin shamans are rare, but have been known to reach
7th level. Their spheres include: Divination, Healing (reversed),
Protection, and Sun (reversed).

In addition to the males, there will be adult females equal to
60% of their number and children equal to the total number of
adults in the lair. Neither will fight in battles.

A goblin tribe has an exact pecking order; each member knows
who is above him and who is below him. They fight amongst
themselves constantly to move up this social ladder.

They often take slaves for both food and labor. The tribe will
have slaves of several races numbering 10-40% of the size of the
tribe. Slaves are always kept shackled, and are staked to a com-
mon chain when sleeping.

Goblins hate most other humanoids, gnomes and dwarves in
particular, and work to exterminate them whenever possible.

Ecology: Goblins live only 50 years or so. They do not need to
eat much, but will kill just for the pleasure of it. They eat any
creature from rats and snakes to humans, In lean times they will
eat carrion. Goblins usually spoil their habitat, driving game
from it and depleting the area of all resources. They are decent
miners, able to note new or unusual construction an an under-
ground area 25% of the time, and any habitat will soon be ex-
panded by a maze-like network of tunnels.

Golems are magically created automatons of great power. The
construction of one involves mighty magics and elemental forces.

Background: Golems predate any known writings. The wizard
who discovered the process, if indeed there was only one, is not
known. Some of the rediscoverers have written down their se-
crets in various arcane manuals, enchanted to aid the reader in
constructing the golem. It is thought that the first golem created
was a flesh golem, possibly an accident of some great wizard ex-
perimenting with reanimating human bodies. Flesh golems are
easier to make than any other sort because they are made of or-
ganic material that once lived. Later, the process was generalized
to suit certain earthen materials, which produces much stronger
golems. Strangely enough, the clay golem can only be animated
by priests.

Theory: Golems are all made from some sort of elemental mate-
rial. So far, the great wizards have only discovered how to use
various earthen materials, such as clay, stone and iron, to make
golems. The sole exception is the flesh golem, due to the special
properties of its organic body. The animating force of the golem is
an elemental spirit from the elemental plane of earth. Since the
spirit is not a natural part of the body, it is not affected by most
spells or even by most weapons (see individual descriptions), The
process of creating the golem binds the unwilling spirit to the arti-
ficial body, and enslaves it to the will of the golem’s creator. The
nature of this spirit is unknown, and has so far eluded the grasp of
all researchers. What is known is that it is hostile to all prime ma-
terial plane life forms, especially toward the spell caster that
bound it to the golem.

The carving or assembling of the golem’s physical body is an
exacting task. Most spell casters end up hiring skilled labor to do
it for them, such as a stone mason or dwarf for stone golems, etc.
If the maker has no experience working in that material, the con-
struction time is doubled. The known spells for creating golems
specify the size of the creature. Anything bigger or smaller won't
work, although it might be worth investigating a new spell that
would. The material costs listed do not include the base physical
body itself, only the unusual materials and spell components that
are consumed or become a permanent part of the golem. The rit-
uals used to animate the golem require a full uninterrupted month
to complete. In all cases the spells used can come from devices,
such as wands or scrolls. If a magical tome is used to make the go-
lem, no spells are needed, and the level of the spell caster can be
significantly lower.

Flesh Golems

Only a wizard of at least 14th level can create a flesh golem. The
pieces of the golem must be sewn together from the dead bodies of
normal humans that have not decayed significantly. This requires
a full month to complete. A minimum of 6 different bodies must
be used, one for each limb, one for the torso (with head), and a
different one for the brain. In some cases, more bodies may be
necessary to forma complete golem. Other materials and ceremo-
nial items for the spells cost 40,000 gold pieces, and are consumed
in the casting. The spells needed are wish, polymorph any object,
geas, protection from normal missiles, and strength.

   
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clay Golems

Only a lawful good priest of at least 17th level can create a clay
golem. The body is sculpted from a single block of clay weighing
at least 1000 pounds, which takes about a month. The other ma-
terials and spell components cost roughly 20,000 gold pieces. The
vestments, which are not consumed and can be reused, cost
30,000 gold pieces. The spells used are resurrection, animate ob-
ject, commune, prayer, and bless.

Stone Golems

Only a wizard of at least 16th level can create a stone golem. The
body is chiseled from a single block of hard stone, such as granite,
weighing at least 3000 pounds, which takes 2 months. The mate-
rials and spell components cost 60,000 gold pieces and the spells
used are wish, polymorph any object, geas, and slow.

Iron Golems

Only a wizard of at least 18th level can create an iron golem. It
takes 3 months, and 5000 pounds of iron, to build the body,
which must be done by a skilled iron smith. The materials and
spell components cost 80,000 gold pieces. The spells used in the
ritual are wish, polymorph any object, geas, and cloud kill. Con-
struction of the body requires an ornate sword which is incorpo-
rated into the monster. A magical sword can be used, in which
case there is a 50% chance that it is drained of magic when the go-
lem is animated. The golem can only use those abilities of the
sword that are automatic. Any property that requires a command
word, or any sentient ability of the sword are lost. If the sword is
ever removed from the golem, it loses all of its magic.

A golem is an artificial humanoid body which is animated by an
elemental spirit and under the control of its creator.

Flesh Golem

The flesh golem stands a head and a half taller than most humans
and weighs almost 350 pounds, It is made from a ghoulish collec-
tion of stolen human body parts, stitched together to form a sin-
gle composite human body. Its skin is the sickly green or yellow of
partially decayed flesh. A flesh golem smells faintly of freshly dug
earth and dead flesh. No natural animal, such as a dog, will will-
ingly track a flesh golem. It wears whatever clothing its creator
desires, usually just a ragged pair of trousers. It has no posses-
sions, including weapons. The golem can not speak, although it
can emit a hoarse roar of sorts. It walks and moves with a stiff
jointed gait, as if it is not in complete control over its body parts.

Combat: The lesser golems are mindless in combat. They follow
the orders of their master explicitly, and are incapable of any strat-
egy or tactics. They are emotionless in combat, and cannot be eas-
ily provoked (unless they have broken control and gone berserk).
They will not use weapons for combat, even if ordered to, always
preferring to strike with their fists. Flesh golems have a strength of
19 for purposes of lifting, throwing or breaking down doors.

Flesh golems can only be struck by a magical weapon. Fire and
cold based spells merely slow them for 2-12 (2d6) rounds. Any
electrical attack restores 1 hit point for each die of damage it
would normally have done. All other spells are ignored by the
creature,

The elemental spirit in a lesser golem is not bound strongly, re-
sulting in a 1% cumulative chance per round of combat, calcu-
lated independently for each fight, that it will break free of its
master. The flesh golem’s master has a 10% chance per round of
regaining control. To do this he must be within 60 feet of the flesh
golem, and the creature must be able to see and hear its master.
No special spells are required to regain control, its creator just has
to talk to it forcefully and persuasively, to convince it to obey.

Habitat/Society: Golems are automatons, artificially created
and under the direct control of their creator. They have no society
and are not associated with any particular habitat. They are fre-
quently used to guard valuable items or places. A lesser golem

See below

L (8' tall)

XP VALUE: 5000 8000

 

 

 

 

can obey simple instructions involving a single, direct action.
They make poor servants because each detail of a task must be
given as a separate command.

Ecology: Golems are not natural creatures, and play no part in
the world’s ecology. They neither eat nor sleep, and “live” until
their bodies are destroyed, usually in combat.

Clay Golem

The clay golem is a humanoid body made from clay, standing a full
2 heads taller than a normal man. It weighs around 600 pounds.
The features are grossly distorted from the human norm. The chest
is overly large, with arms attached by a thick knot of shoulder. Its
arms hang down to its knees, and end in short stubby fingers. It has
no neck, anda large head with broad flat features. Its legs are short
and bowlegged, with wide flat feet. A clay golem wears no clothing
except for a metal or stiff leather garment around its hips. It smells
faintly of clay. The golem can not speak, or make any noise. It
walks and moves with a slow and clumsy gait, almost looking as if
it were not in control over its actions.

Combat: Clay golems conform to the strategies listed above for
the flesh golem except as noted here. A clay golem has a strength
of 20 for the purposes of lifting, throwing or smashing objects.
They can only be struck by magical blunt weapons such as ham-
mers or maces. A move earth spell will drive the golem back 120
feet and inflict 3-36 (3d12) points of damage upon it. A disinte-
grate spell merely slows the golem for 1-6 rounds and causes 1-12
points of damage. An earthquake spell cast directly at a clay go-
lem will stop it from moving that turn and inflict 5-50 (5d10)
points of damage. After it has engaged in at least one round of
combat, the clay golem can haste itself for 3 rounds. It can only
do this once per day. Damage done by the golem can only be
cured by a heal spell from a priest of 17th level or greater.

The elemental spirit in a lesser golem is not bound strongly, re-
sulting in a 1% cumulative chance per round of combat, calcu-
lated independently for each fight, that it will break free of its
master. If a clay golem does manage to break control, it becomes
a berserker, attacking everything in sight until it is destroyed. Its
first action is to haste itself, if it can. Unlike the flesh golem, there
is no chance to regain control of a rampaging clay golem.

A greater golem is an artificial humanoid body which has been
animated by an elemental spirit but remains under the complete
control of its creator.

Stone Golem

Astone golem is 9/2 feet tall, and weighs around 2000 pounds.
Its body is of roughly chiseled stone, frequently stylized to suit its
creator. For example it might be carved to to look like it is wear-
ing armor with a particular symbol on the chest plate. Sometimes
designs are worked into the stone of its limbs. The head may be
chiseled to resemble a helmet or other head piece. Regardless of
these elements, it always has the basic humanoid parts (2 arms, 2
legs, head with 2 eyes, nose, mouth etc.). It is always weaponless
and never wears clothing.

Combat: Greater golems are mindless in combat, only follow-
ing the simple tactics of their masters. They are completely emo-
tionless and cannot be swayed in any way from their instructions.
They will not pick up and use weapons in combat, even if ordered
to, always preferring their fists. Stone golems have a strength of
22, for purposes of breaking or throwing things.

The stone golem is immune to any weapon, except those of +2
or better enchantment. A rock to mud spell slows a golem for 2-12
(2d6) rounds. Its reverse, mud to rock acts to heal the golem, re-
storing all lost hit points. A flesh to stone spell does not actually
change the golem’s structure, but does make it vulnerable to any
normal attack for the following round. This does not include
spells, except those that will cause direct damage. All other spells
are ignored. Once every other round, the stone golem can cast a
slow spell upon any opponent with 10 feet of it.

Habitat/Society: Golems are automatons, artificially created
and under the direct control of their creator. They have no society
and are not associated with any particular habitat. They are fre-
quently used to guard valuable items or places. Unlike the lesser
golems, the greater golems are always under the complete control
of their master. A greater golem can obey simple instructions in-
volving direct actions with simple conditional phrases. Although
this is better than a lesser golem is capable of following, they still

See below
See below

L (12' tall)
Fearless (19-20)

 

 

 

 

 

make poor servants. Any given task could take several separate
commands to direct the golem to its completion.

Ecology: Golems are not natural creatures, and play no part in
the ecology of the world. They neither eat nor sleep, and “live”
until they are destroyed, usually in combat. Certain spells (see
above) can be used to heal or repair any damage done to them in
combat. This is usually done by their creators to insure long and
valuable service.

Iron Golem

An iron golem is twice the height of a normal man, and weighs
around 5000 pounds. It can be fashioned in any stylized manner,
just like the stone golems, although it almost always is built dis-
playing armor of some sort. Its features are much smoother in
contrast to the stone golem. Iron golems are sometimes found
with a short sword (relative to their size) in one hand. On ex-
tremely rare occasions this sword will be magical.

The iron golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor
does it have any distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponder-
ously smooth gait at half the speed of a normal man. Each step
causes the floor to tremble, unless it is on a thick, solid founda-
tion.

Combat: The iron golem conforms to the strategies listed for the
stone golem except as described here. It has a strength of 24 for
the purposes of lifting, throwing or breaking objects. The iron go-
lem is immune to any weapon, except those of +3 or better en-
chantment. Magical electrical attacks will slow it for 3 rounds,
and magical fire attacks actually repair 1 hit point of damage for
each hit die of damage it would have caused. All other spells are
ignored. Iron golems are subject to the damage inflicted by a rust
monster. Once every 7 rounds, beginning either the first or sec-
ond round of combat, the iron golem breathes out a cloud of poi-
sonous gas. It does this automatically, with no regard to the
effects it might have. The gas cloud fills a 10 foot cube directly in
front of it, which dissipates by the following round, assuming
there is somewhere for the gas to go.

Halflings are a hard-working race of peaceful citizens. Their communities
are similar to those of humans, although they usually contain many bur-
row homes in addition to surface cottages.

Halflings average 3'/2 feet in height, have ruddy complexions, with
sandy to dark brown hair, and blue or hazel eyes. Their dress is often col-
orful but serviceable, and they like to wear caps or tunics. In addition to
their own language, many halflings also speak the common tongue,
gnome, goblin, and orcish.

Combat: _Halflings fight with great ferocity in defense of good or their
home. They are very skilled with both the sling and the bow (receiving a
+3 bonus on all attack rolls) and use these weapons to great advantage in
battle. Their tactics often involve feints to draw their attackers into the
open where they can be subjected to a volley of fire from cover.

When equipped for battle, halflings wear padded or leather armor. A half-
ling force is usually armed with short swords and hand axes. In addition, two-
thirds of the halflings will be carrying either a sling or short bow.

All halflings above normal level will have Armor Class 6, while those of 3rd
or 4th level wear chain mail over their leather (AC 4). Higher level halflings
have a 10 percent chance per level of having a magic weapon or armor.

Asall halflings are naturally resistant to magic and poisons they save at
4 levels above their actual level. In addition, halflings are exceedingly
clever at quiet movement and hiding. In combat, their opponents receive
a-S on their surprise roll, In natural terrain halflings are considered invisi-
ble when they are hiding in vegetation.

Habitat/Society: Halfling villages will generally have between 30 and 300
(30d10) individuals living in them. For every 30 halflings in a particular
community there will be two 2nd level fighters and a 3rd level priest. If
more than 90 halflings are encountered there will be an additional leader
of 3rd level fighting ability. If more than 150 are encountered there will
also be the following additional halfling warriors in the group: one 4th
level fighter, two 3rd level fighters and three 2nd level fighters. Further, a
community of 150 halflings will have a Sth level priest.

Cheerful and outgoing, halflings, take great pleasure in simple crafts
and nature. Their fingers, though short, are very dexterous allowing them
to create objects of great beauty. Halflings shun water and extremes in
temperature preferring to settle in temperate pastoral countrysides.

 

Ecology: Halflings hunt occasionally, but prefer breads, vegetables and
fruits, with an occasional pheasant on the side. They have a life expect-
ancy of 100 years on the average.

Tallfellow

A taller (4' +) and slimmer halfling with fair skin and hair, tallfellows are
somewhat rare among the halfling folk. Tallfellows generally speak the
language of elves in addition to those listed previously and greatly enjoy
their company. In combat, tallfellows often ride ponies and carry spears
or small lances. Tallfellows of strength 17 or more can rise to 6th level
fighting ability. They live 180 years on average.

Stout

These halflings are shorter and stockier than the more common hairfoots.
Stouts take great pleasure in gems and fine masonry, often working as jewelers
or stone cutters. They rarely mix with humans and elves, but enjoy the com-
pany of dwarves and often speak their language fluently. Like dwarves, stouts
have infravision (90’) and can detect sloping passageways (75% chance).
Stouts with a strength score of 17 or better can work their way up to the 6th
level of fighting ability. Their ties with the dwarven folk have spilled over into
their combat tactics, with many stouts employing hammers and morningstars
in combat. Stouts also have no dislike of water and, in fact, many are excellent
swimmers. Stouts can reach an age of 140 or more years.

Harpies are wicked avian beasts that prey upon nearly all crea-
tures but prefer the flesh of humans and demihumans.

Harpies have the bodies of vultures but the upper torsos and
heads of women. Their human features are youthful, but hid-
eous, with frayed unkempt hair and decaying teeth. A foul odor
surrounds all harpies and that which they touch. Harpies never
bathe nor clean themselves in any way. Their dress, if anything, is
limited to tattered rags and shiny trinkets taken from previous
victims.

The language of harpies, in contrast to their enticing song, is a
horrible collection of cackles and shrieks. Although there are in-
stances of harpies which could speak the languages of other crea-
tures, these are few and far between.

Combat: The song of the harpies has the ability to charm all hu-
mans and demihumans who hear it (elves are resistant to the
charm). Those who fail their saving throw versus spell will pro-
ceed towards the harpy with all possible speed, only to stand en-
tranced while the harpy slays them at its leisure. This charm will
last as long as the harpy continues to sing. Harpies can sing even
while engaged in melee.

It is impossible to fend off a harpy song simply by clasping
hands over ears because the charm takes effect the moment the
first note is heard. Characters making prior preparations to block
out the sound, (wax in ears, etc.), are immune to the effects of the
song. In addition, characters who make their saving throw are
thereafter immune to its effect, until such time as they encounter a
different group of harpies.

If forced to fight, harpies can do so quite effectively by deliver-
ing a vicious bite and raking simultaneously with their talons.
About 50% of all harpies encountered will use weapons, usually
a bone club (damage 1-8) which they wield surprisingly well.

The touch of a harpy upon a charmed individual has a similar,
though somewhat less potent, effect. Those who are touched and
miss their saving throw versus spell will stand mesmerized for
20 +1d10 hours.

The effect of either charm is broken if the harpy is slain.

Habitat/Society: Harpies make their home upon coastlines in
regions near shipping lanes and by well-traveled paths. There
they use their song to lure travelers to their doom.

Their lair is usually a shallow cave, which they defile until no

 

 

 

 

 

 

animal dare approach it. Here they remain unless hunting. Har-
pies often carry victims back to their lair to devour them in more
familiar surroundings.

Harpies have little use for treasure, other than the shiny bau-
bles which they often attach to their clothes. Other items, such as
gold and weapons, are frequently interspersed amongst the filth
and bones that litter the cave. This refuse can reach a depth of
several feet in the oldest of harpy lairs.

A typical harpy lair houses about a half-dozen of these
wretched creatures. No male harpies have ever been seen and it
seems that harpies can reproduce at will by laying a single egg
every other year. Harpies take no care of their young, which live
off carcasses and cave vermin until they themselves are old
enough to sing and hunt.

Harpies have no social structure, frequently quarreling over
who gets what part of a victim and when to stop the torturing and
start the feasting. Occasionally these quarrels will turn violent, so
that more than one harpy feast has begun with the last minute ad-
dition of the losing harpy to the menu.

Harpies will occassionally agree to cooperate in evil acts with
other humanoids.

Ecology: Harpies hunt all manner of beasts, remaining in an
area for as long as the food supply lasts. They are despised and
greatly feared by all creatures weaker than themselves.

Harpies have a voracious appetite, devouring all manner of
man and beast. They take great delight in torture, and frequently
kill for pleasure. Slain victims which harpies do not eat are simply
left to rot.

Their life span is unknown but seems to be about 50 years.

Hobgoblins are a fierce humanoid race that wage a perpetual war
with the other humanoid races. They are intelligent, organized,
and aggressive.

The typical hobgoblin is a burly humanoid standing 6/2’ tall.
Their hairy hides range from dark reddish-brown to dark gray.
Their faces show dark red or red-orange skin. Large males have
blue or red noses. Hobgoblin eyes are either yellowish or dark
brown while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be
brightly colored, often bold, blood red. Any leather is always
tinted black. Hobgoblin weaponry is kept polished and repaired.

Hobgoblins have their own language and often speak with
orcs, goblins, and carnivorous apes. Roughly 20% of them can
speak the common tongue of man.

Combat: Hobgoblins in a typical force will be equipped with
polearms (30%), morningstars (20%), swords and bows (20%),
spears (10%), swords and spears (10%), swords and morning
stars (5%), or swords and whips (5%).

Hobgoblins fight equally well in bright light or virtual dark-
ness, having infravision with a range of 60 feet.

Hobgoblins hate elves and always attack them first.

Habitat/Society: Hobgoblins are nightmarish mockeries of the
humanoid races who have a military society organized in tribal
bands. Each tribe is intensely jealous of its status. Chance meet-
ings with other tribes will result in verbal abuse (85%) or open
fighting (15%). Hobgoblin tribes are found in almost any climate
or subterranean realm.

A typical tribe of hobgoblins will have between 20 and 200
(2d10 x 10) adult male warriors. In addition, for every 20 male
hobgoblins there will be a leader (known as a sergeant) and two
assistants. These have 9 hit points each but still fight as 1 +1 Hit
Die monsters. Groups numbering over 100 are led by a sub-chief
who has 16 hit points and an Armor Class of 3. The great strength
of a sub-chief gives it a +2 on its damage rolls and allows it to
fight as a 3 Hit Die monster. If the hobgoblins are encountered in
their lair, they will be led by a chief with AC 2, 22 hit points, and
+3 points of damage per attack, who fights as a 4 Hit Die mon-
ster, The chief has 5-20 (5d4) sub-chiefs acting as bodyguards.
Leaders and chiefs always carry two weapons.

Each tribe has a distinctive battle standard which is carried into

 

 

 

 

combat to inspire the troops. If the tribal chief is leading the bat-
tle, he will carry the standard with him, otherwise it will be held
by one of his sub-chiefs.

In addition to the warriors present in a hobgoblin tribe, there
will be half again that many females and three times as many chil-
dren as adult males.

Fully 80% of all known hobgoblin lairs are subterranean com-
plexes, The remaining 20% are surface villages which are fortified
witha ditch, fence, 2 gates, and 3-6 guard towers. Villages are of-
ten built upon ruined humanoid settlements and may incorporate
defensive features already present in the ruins.

Hobgoblin villages possess artillery in the form of 2 heavy cata-
pults, 2 light catapults, and a ballista for each 50 warriors. Under-
ground complexes may be guarded by 2-12 carnivorous apes
(60%).

They are highly adept at mining and can detect new construc-
tion, sloping passages, and shifting walls 40% of the time.

Ecology: Hobgoblins feel superior to goblins or orcs and may
act as leaders for them. In such cases, the “lesser races” are used as
battle fodder. Hobgoblin mercenaries may work for powerful or
rich evil humanoids.

Koalinth

This marine species of hobgoblin is similar to the land dwelling
variety in many respects. Koalinth dwell in shallow fresh or salt
water and make their homes in caves.

Their bodies have adapted to marine environments via the evo-
lution of gills. Their webbed fingers and toes give them a move-
ment rate of 12 when swimming. Their bodies are sleeker than
those of hobgoblins and they have light green skin. They speak an
unusual dialect of the hobgoblin tongue.

They tend to employ thrusting weapons like spears and pole
arms. Koalinth are every bit as disagreeable as hobgoblins, prey-
ing on every thing they come across, especially aquatic humanoid
and demi-human races. They detest aquatic elves.

Homonculi are small mystical beings created by magicians for
spying and other special tasks.

The average homonculous is vaguely humanoid in form. It is

18 inches tall and its greenish, reptilian skin may have spots or
warts. They have leathery, bat-like wings with a span of 24 inches
and a mouth filled with long, pointed teeth that can inject a po-
tent sleeping venom.
Combat: The homonculous is a quick and agile flyer which uses
this ability to great advantage in combat. It can dart to and fro so
quickly that any attempt to capture it short of a net or web spell is
almost impossible.

In combat, the homonculous will land on its chosen victim and
bite with its needle-like fangs. In addition to doing 1-3 points of
damage, the creature injects a powerful venom. Anyone bitten by
the homonculous must save versus poison or fall into a comatose
sleep for 5-30 (Sd6) minutes.

The creature's saving throws are the same as those of its crea-
tor. While most attacks against either the homonculous or creator
do not affect the other, there is one exception. Any attack which
destroys the homonculous causes its creator to suffer 2-20 (2d10)
points of damage. Conversely, if the creator is slain, the homon-
culous also dies and its body swiftly melts away into a pool of
ichor,

Habitat/Society: Homonculi are artificial creatures created by
wizards as living tools. The process by which one is created is
long, complicated, and expensive. Any wizard who desires a ho-
monculous servant must first locate and hire an alchemist. The
wizard must provide one pint of his own blood and 500-2,000
(1d4 x 500) gold pieces. The blood becomes the basis for the crea-
ture’s body while the money pays for a variety of other supplies
and the alchemist’s time. The alchemist requires 1-4 weeks to
transform the blood into the necessary magical base. The wizard
is then sent for and required to cast mending, mirror image, and
wizard eye spells upon the fluids. As the last of these spells is
worked, the fluids spontaneously coagulate and form the body of
the homonculous.

The homonculous is telepathically linked to its creator. It
knows everything that its master knows and transmits everything
it sees and hears to him. The creator can telepathically control the
actions of the homonculous at a range of up to 480 yards. The ho-
monculous will never willingly travel beyond the limits of contact
with its master, though it can be removed from that region by

 

 

 

 

 

 

force. As soon as it loses contact with its master, the creature pan-
ics and will do anything to regain contact. Contact between the
two cannot be maintained across planar or dimensional barriers.
If either the creator or homonculous is on another plane, the ho-
monculous will remain near the point where it was last in contact
with its master.

Homonculi are a reflection of their creator. They have the crea-
tor’s alignment, basic intelligence, and even physical manner-
isms. They are mute but can write if the creator is literate. They
may assist their creator in a variety of tasks including magical en-
deavors, although they cannot themselves cast spells.

Homonculi lairs are in the homes of their creators. Indulgent
wizards may provide a specially built bed, nest, or living cham-
ber. Otherwise, the homonculous simply perches wherever it can.

Ecology: Homonculi are nothing more than tools. They have
no place in the natural world and are not part of any ecological
system. They provide the wizard who created them with a variety
of useful services. Commonly, a homonculous is called upon to
act as a spy, scout, messenger, or emissary. Because of the poten-
tial harm which the death of a homonculous inflicts on its master,
they are seldom employed as body guards or living weapons.

Although they are magical creations, homonculi possess the
same biological functions as non-magical creatures. They must
rest and require food and drink in order to survive. When eating,
they share the tastes of their masters and generally consume
about as much as a typical cat.

There are rumors of magical means by which non-wizards can
acquire their own form of homonculous. Although these are not
widely believed to be valid, there are those who report having
seen the process or its results first hand. If such a procedure exists,
it would be quite valuable to its discoverer.

Giant hornets are nothing more than fantastically enlarged ver-
sions of normal insects. Unlike their more common cousins, they
are often hostile and aggressive.

The giant hornet has a 5’ long body and a 10’ wingspan. Their
chitinous exoskeleton is marked by shiny, parallel stripes of black
and yellow. The abdomen is tipped by a retractable stinger.

Combat: Giant hornets are solitary creatures who will attack
on sight. It swoops down onto its prey and takes hold with its legs
while its stinger stabs into the victim's body. In addition to inflict-
ing 1-4 points of damage, the stinger also injects a potent toxin. If
a saving throw versus poison is not made, the toxin does 5-30
points of damage and paralyzes the victim for 2-12 (2d6) hours.

Smoke and flame are powerful weapons in any battle against
these giant insects. Smoke causes them to become somewhat tran-
quilized, invoking a -2 penalty on its attack rolls. Flame frightens
them greatly, and they will suffer a -4 on their attack rolls against
anyone who is using it to defend himself. The hornet’s wings are
especially vulnerable to flame and will be consumed by any form
of fire-based attack in one round. Although this does no physical
harm to the hornet, it does render it flightless until its wings grow
back in 2-12 (2d6) weeks.

The giant hornet is a very noisy flier and the buzzing of its
wings can be heard up to 150’ away. Underground, this range is
halved by each wall or closed door between the monster and the
listener.

Habitat/Society: Giant hornets are believed to be the result of
magical experiments gone awry. Save for the fact that they are
much more aggressive than the common hornet, their gigantic
size has not changed their instinctual behavior.

Once per month, female hornets will prepare a nest and attract
a male for mating. Together, the two create an egg chamber in
some out of the way place. Egg chambers can be established in
pits, abandoned buildings, caves, or any similar area. The walls
of the chamber are coated with a mixture of mud, cellulose, and
hornet saliva which hardens into rock. The construction of the
chamber takes between 1 and 6 days, depending on its size.

When the chamber is completed, the couple mates. The male
departs shortly afterwards, but dies within a day from exhaus-

 

 

 

 

 

 

tion. The female leaves the chamber in search of a victim which it
paralyzes and carries back to the chamber. Once in the chamber,
the hornet uses its mud-like compound to bind its prey and injects
it with 2-4 (2d8) eggs. It leaves promptly thereafter, pausing only
to seal the egg chamber (which takes 1-6 hours). Mere hours later,
the eggs hatch and the larvae within begin to feed on the body
around them. The six inch long larvae do 1 point of damage each
per turn. After devouring the body, the young hornets break
through the wall of the egg chamber by dissolving it with their sa-
liva and fly off to begin their lives in the wild.

Although hornets do not keep treasure troves, their egg cham-
bers may be a source of valuables in the form of victims’ posses-
sions.

Ecology: The giant hornets are the result of deliberate tamper-
ing with nature. They roam the world mindlessly following their
primal instinct to reproduce.

Hornet toxin decays quickly when removed from the body. It
can be used to coat blades and such only if the toxin is less than
two days old. The toxin may also be used in the preparation of
anti-paralysis potions and antidotes.

Giant Wasp:

These insects are very similar to giant hornets but live in swarms
of as many as 20 individuals. Giant wasps are cooperative insects
who build and maintain immense hives. Constructed of a thick
paper-like substance, giant wasp hives are home to 21-40
(1d20 + 20) adults and 100-400 (1d4x100) eggs, larvae, and pupae.
Their hives may surround a large tree or fill a vast chamber in the
earth.

A giant wasp first attacks with its powerful bite (2d4 points of
damage), then stabs with its stinger (1-4 points). Failure to makea
save against poison means that any victim hit by the stinger has
been injected with a poison similar to that employed by the giant
hornet. Paralyzed victims are carried back to the hive and placed
in the communal egg chamber where they are quickly consumed
by the hungry young.

Ahydra can bring up to four of its heads into action against a single foe,
biting once with each of them.

Every time a hydra takes 8 points of damage, one of its heads is as-
sumed to be cut or torn from its body. When this happens, a reflex seals
neck arteries shut to prevent massive blood loss.

Hydrae attack according to the number of heads they have. Therefore,
a 10-headed hydra continues to attack as a 10 HD monster even after sev-
eral heads have been slain.

Attacks on the body have no effect unless a single attack inflicts damage
equal to the hydra’s original hit points.

Habitat/Society: Hydrae are solitary creatures who prefer dismal sur-
roundings. They gather only to mate.

Ecology: Despite the hydra’s size and multiple attacks, they are often
preyed upon by dragons. Hydrae are impossible to train.

Lernaean Hydra

Although similar to a normal hydra, Lernaean hydrae will regenerate two
heads for each one that is severed. A maximum of 12 heads can be grown.
The new heads form in 1-4 rounds and can be avoided only by the prompt
application of a flame to the neck following the attack which destroyed
the first head. This hydra’s body is immune to all attacks.

Pyrohydra

These reddish hydra have 7 or 8 heads which are able to breathe a jet of
fire (5 feet wide and 20 feet long) twice per day. This attack does 8 points
of damage which is halved is a save versus breath weapon is made.

Cryohydra

Each head of this purplish-brown hydrae is able to breathe a stream of
frost 10 feet wide and 20 feet long which does 8 points of damage to those
hit by it. A save versus breath weapon is allowed for half damage.

Hyenae are canines who roam warm grasslands and plains. They
__ are primarily scavangers, but will hunt small game on occasion.
Their powerful jaws give them a nasty bite.

Hyenae are ugly animals. Roughly the size of a large dog, the hye-
na's body is covered with a light brown or golden fur. Its feet, mark-
ings, and belly are black. The hyena’s shorter rear legs make it look
clumsy—an illusion which is quickly dispelled when it attacks.

Combat: Hyenae are cowards. They do not attack unless their
_ prey is helpless, outnumbered, or dead already.

Hyenae surround a victim and rush in at it from all sides, at-
tacking with a strong bite that does 2-8 (2d4) points of damage. A
natural attack roll of 20 indicates that the hyena has locked its
jaws onto the victim. Once this happens, the animal will not let
go until it suffers 2 or more points of damage. Such holding bites
do not do additional damage but can slow the victim down be-
cause of the hyena’s extra weight. Each hyena reduces a victim's
movement rate by 6. The number of hyenae which can lock onto
a victim is determined by its size. One hyena can lock onto a tiny
animal, two to a small one, and so forth.

Habitat/Society: Hyenae roam the open plains of warm, grassy
regions. They are usually found within sight of a herd of animals
like zebra and antelope. Generally, there will be 1 hyena for every
10 herd animals being followed. A typical hyena pack can survive
on one man-sized animal every three days. If they attack and kill
an animal, they will strip it to the bones in short order. Any car-
rion which they encounter will also be consumed.

Hyenae are instinctively aware of their place in the animal hier-
archy. They defer to larger or more powerful predators like lions.
If such an animal makes a kill they will sit 50’ to 100’ away and
patiently wait for the predator to finish and leave. If given the
chance, they have been known to try to snatch portions of the
carcass and run. They may openly challenge other, less powerful
or numerous, predators.

Hyenae travel in packs composed of an even mixture of adult
males, females, and young. Although they do not mate for life, a
hyena couple will remain together for several years. The male as-
sists in caring for the 2-4 cubs which are born in each litter. The
young do not nurse, but are fed regurgitated food in a manner
similar to that employed by many avian species.

 

 

 

 

 

During their first year of life cubs will not attack. They are one
Hit Die animals who run for the protection of their parents and
the pack if threatened. During the second year, the cubs gain an
additional Hit Die and begin to hunt alongside the adults. Hyenae
become fully mature in three years.

Ecology: Hyenae are active scavengers who feed on the carrion
left behind by other, larger predators. They are also able to take
living prey, although they normally restrict their hunting to
small, young, old, or sick animals. They have strong constitu-
tions and digestive tracts that enable them to safely digest even
diseased meat.

Hyenae produce few useful byproducts. The skins make poor
leather, the fur tends to fall out, and the meat has a decidedly ran-
cid taste. Cubs are difficult to domesticate as they usually revert
to the wild upon hitting maturity. However, they may be found as
companions of nomadic, aboriginal people.

Hyaenodon

Although the hyaenodon resembles a giant hyena it is actually
not related at all. It is a survivor of prehistoric times, a predator
that evolved into a canine-like form. Hyaenodon markings are
similar to those of hyenae, although the dominant fur color is a
lion-like gold. Despite their genetic differences, they are very sim-
ilar to hyenae in temperament and behavior. Hyaenodon females
give birth to litters of 1-4 cubs. These mature within 4 years.

Its savage bite does 3-12 (3d4) points of damage and it can lock
onto its victims just as smaller hyenae do. If the hyaenodon does
this, the victim’s movement rate is cut by 12 for each hyaenodon
that attaches itself. Hyaenodon packs will devour one man-sized
victim per day. Because of their larger size, they are able to take
large prey such as elephants, oxen, and buffalo. If a giant hyena
suffers 2 or more points of burning damage, it immediately flees
the area in search of a spot to tend its wounds.

Imps are diminutive creatures of an evil nature who roam the
world and act as familiars for lawful evil wizards and priests.

The average imp is a 2’ humanoid with leathery, bat-like wings,
a barbed tail, and sharp, twisted horns. Its skin is a dark red and
its horns and jagged teeth are a gleaming white.

The imp can polymorph itself into two other animal forms.
The most commonly encountered alternate forms are those of a
large spider, raven, giant rat, or goat. In such forms the imp is
physically identical to a normal animal.

Combat: In its natural form, the imp attacks with the wicked
stinger on its tail. In addition to inflicting 1-4 points of damage,
this stinger injects a powerful poison which is so deadly that those
who fail their save versus poison are instantly slain by it. When it
is polymorphed, the imp attacks with the natural weaponry of its
adopted form, though the goat and raven forms lack damaging
attacks.

The imp can use its special magical abilities no matter what its
form. All imps are able to detect good, detect magic, or become
invisible at will. Once per day they can use a suggestion.

Imps are immune to attacks based on cold, fire, or electricity
and resist all other spell attacks as if they were 7 Hit Die creatures.
They can be harmed only by silver or magical weapons and are
able to regenerate one hit point per melee round.

Habitat/Society: Imps are beings of a very evil nature who orig-
inate on the darkest of evil planes. Their main purpose on the
Prime Material plane is to spread evil by assisting lawful evil wiz-
ards and priests. When such a person is judged worthy of an imp’s
service, the imp comes in answer to a find familiar spell.

Once they have contacted their new “master”, imps begin at
once to take control of his actions. Although imps maintain the il-
lusion that the summoner is in charge, the actual relationship is
closer to that of a workman (the imp) and his tools (the master).

Although an imp’s body can be destroyed on the Prime Mate-
rial plane, it is not so easily slain. When its physical form is lost,
its corrupt spirit instantly returns to its home plane where it is re-
formed and, after a time, returned to our world to resume its
work.

While they are technically in the service of their master, imps re-
tain a basic independence and ambition to become more powerful
someday. They may acquire treasure from those they slay, and will

 

 

 

 

 

 

often pilfer valuables encountered during their travels.

The imp confers some of its powers upon its master. A tele-
pathic link connects the two whenever they are within one mile of
each other. This enables the master to receive all of the imp’s sen-
sory impressions, including its infravision. The master also gains
the imp’s inherent 25% magical resistance and is able to regener-
ate just as the imp does. If the imp is within telepathic range, the
master acts as if he were one level higher than he actually is. Con-
versely, if the imp is more than a mile away, the master acts as if
he were one level of ability below his actual rank. If the imp is
killed, the master instantly drops by four levels, though these can
be regained in the usual manner.

Ecology: Imps are the errand boys of the powerful evil beings
who command the darkest planes. They often act as emissaries
and agents, but their primary task is to enhance the spread of evil
in our world.

Quasit

Quasits are chaotic evil counterparts to imps. The chaotic evil
priests and wizards which quasits “serve” gain the same benefits
and disadvantages that an imp’s master does. Like imps, each
quasit can assume two other forms. Those most commonly cho-
sen by quasits are bats, giant centipedes, frogs, or wolves. They
can use their magic in any of their forms.

The quasit attacks with its clawed hands (doing 1-2 points
each) and its deadly bite (doing 1-4 points). The quasit's claws are
coated in a toxin which causes anyone struck by them to save ver-
sus poison or lose one point of dexterity for 2-12 (2d6) rounds.
The effects of multiple wounds are cumulative.

Quasits can turn invisible, detect good, or detect magic at will.
They regenerate 1 hit point per round and can unleash a blast of
fear with a 30 foot range radius once per day. Once each week the
quasit can commune with the lower planes (asking up to 6 ques-
tions).

Quasits can only be harmed by cold iron or magical weapons.
They are able to resist magic 25% of the time, save as if they were
7 Hit Die monsters and are immune to cold, fire, and lightning.

The invisible stalker is a creature from the elemental plane of air.
Those encountered on the Prime Material plane have almost al-
ways been summoned by wizards to fulfill a specific task.

The true form of the invisible stalker is unknown. On the Mate-
rial, Astral, or Ethereal planes, the invisible stalker can only be
perceived as a shimmering air mass which looks much like the re-
fraction effect caused by hot air passing in front of cold.

Invisible stalkers understand the common speech of men, but
can not speak it. They can converse only in their own language,
which sounds much like the roaring and whooshing of a great
wind storm.

Combat: Invisible stalkers attack by using the air itself as a
weapon. It is capable of creating a sudden, intense vortex that
batters a victim for 4-16 (4d4) points of damage. Such attacks af-
fect a single victim on the same plane as the invisible stalker.

Due to their invisibility, these creatures impose a —6 penalty
on the surprise rolls of those they choose to attack. Similarly, all
opponents who are unable to see or detect invisible foes are at a
—2 on their attack rolls. Although they are fully invisible on the
Prime Material plane, their outlines can be dimly perceived on
the Astral or Ethereal planes.

Invisible stalkers can only be killed on the elemental plane of
air. If attacked on another plane, they automatically return to
their home plane when their total hit points are exceeded by the
damage they suffered.

Habitat/Society: Little is known about the lives of these crea-
tures on their home plane. It is assumed that they are similar to
normal air elementals when encountered there.

Those present on the material plane are there as the result of a
conjuration by some wizard. This magic causes the creature to
serve its summoner for a time. The conjurer retains full command
of the stalker until it either fulfills its duties or is defeated and
driven back to its home plane. Once given a task, an invisible
stalker is relentless. They are faultless trackers who can detect
any trail less than a day old. If ordered to attack, they will do so
with great fury and will cease their efforts only upon their own
destruction or the direct orders of their master. Once their mis-
sion is accomplished, the creature is free to return to its home
plane.

The invisible stalker is, at best, an unwilling servant. It resents
any task assigned to it, although brief, uncomplicated labors may

be seen as something of a diversion and thus undertaken with lit-
tle resentment. Tasks that require a week or more of its time will
drive the invisible stalker to pervert the stated intent of the com-
mand. Such commands must be carefully worded and come from
a powerful wizard. An invisible stalker may look for a loop hole
in the command as a means of striking back at its master. For ex-
ample, a simple command such as “keep me safe from all harm”
may result in the stalker carrying the conjurer back to the elemen-
tal plane of air and leaving him there in a well hidden location.

Each day of the invisible stalker’s indenturedness there is a 1%
cumulative chance that the creature will seek a means to pervert
its commands and free itself of servitude. If no option is open, the
creature must continue to serve.

Ecology: Invisible stalkers are a species unwillingly trans-
planted to the Prime Material plane. They are slaves whose terms
of servitude dominate their brief stays. Those who have been sub-
jected to great hardship, assigned very difficult tasks, or who
have faced death at the hands of humanoids, tend to retain a dis-
trust or outright hatred of them. Those that have had an easy time
during past periods of service or who are first time arrivals on the
Prime Material plane may be easier to deal with. Such feelings
may carry over to influence encounters with humanoids traveling
in the aerial plane. Anyone who has befriended an invisible
stalker in the past will find that voyages through the plane of Ele-
mental Air are far less hazardous than they might otherwise have
been.

Invisible stalkers only obey those who actually summon them
and few wizards can be commissioned to summon such a being on
another's behalf. Some mercenary wizards have been able to con-
struct the necessary summons onto scrolls that are usable by oth-
ers. These sell for between 5,000 and 10,000 gp and are very
dangerous to use. Even the slightest error can cause users of such
scrolls to come to a tragic end.

Jackals are small, canine scavengers that roam the warm grass-
lands of the world. They are neither fierce nor brave, but are
quite common. There are three known species of jackal in the
world: asian, black-backed, and side-striped. Except for their
markings, these animals are very similar.

The typical jackal has a narrow head and a sharp, pointed
snout which looks very similar to that of a fox. In its other char-
acteristics, however, the animal is much like a wolf or dog. Its fur
is typically a tawny buff in color and quite grizzled. The tip of the
animal's bushy tail is much darker, often shading to black.

Combat: Asa rule, any jackal will flee if charged or threatened
by another predator. In fact, they will even abandon their efforts
at hunting if their prey turns out to have more life left in it than
they expected.

When a jackal does attack, it will do so by biting. Although this
is not an especially fierce attack, it serves the animal well enough.
Often, jackals will dart in to bite a victim and then quickly retreat
to a safe distance to examine the effects of their attack. If more
than one jackal is trying to bring down a particular animal, they
will attack in a haphazard manner with little or no coordination
of their efforts.

Habitat/Society: Jackals inhabit plains, deserts, and grasslands
throughout the warmer regions of the world. During the day,
when the sun is too hot for their tastes, they remain in holes
which they have dug in the ground.

At night, they come out to hunt. Although they usually search
for prey in pairs, they can be encountered in small groups of up to
six individuals. Jackals are loath to attack healthy animals who
might be able to harm them. Rather, they will stalk only those too
feeble (either old, young, sick, or injured) to put up much of a
fight. Carrion is a regular part of the jackal’s diet, as are occa-
sional pieces of fruit.

Whenever a jackal is afoot, it habitually utters its piercing cry.
Known asa pheal, this frightening sound can be heard for quite a
distance and is often far more terrifying than the animal itself.
Herbivores (including domesticated ones) will tend to become
frightened by the pheal of a jackal. There is a 10% chance per
jackal that the howling will cause a herd of herbivores to panic
and attempt to flee. Horses and similar animals can be calmed by
their keepers, cutting the chance for panic in half.

Despite its less-than-dangerous nature, the jackal plays a dark

 

 

 

 

 

 

and mysterious role in the mythoi of various human cultures.
Their place as carrion eaters and killers of the defenseless has
earned them a reputation for cruelty and evil deeds which is
wholly undeserved. Jackal attacks on men and other demihu-
mans are few and far between. In many regions which are fre-
quented by jackals, numerous horror stories will be told about
the doings of jackals but, oddly enough, further investigation will
usually show that these are second hand reports of questionable
origin.

Ecology: Jackals are reluctant predators and their position in
the food chain is that of a scavenger rather than a hunter. By
hunting and killing sick or weak animals, they play an important
part in the process of natural selection. In addition, the carrion
which they consume, would otherwise rot and become a potential
health hazard and breeding ground for disease.

Jackal pups mature quickly and in just over a year they are able
to fend for themselves quite well. They live for 12 to 15 years in
the wild.

In those places where they share territory with men, it is quite
common for jackals to interbreed with domesticated dogs. Fur-
ther, both the pups born to such a mating and adult wild jackals
are easily domesticated. Thus, although they are not fierce
enough to act as guards or hunting animals, they are often found
in human communities near their lands as pets.

Young, wild, or domesticated jackals are seldom available on
the commercial market, however, and are worth little when of-
fered for sale.

The jackalwere is a terrible and savage creature which preys on
unsuspecting travelers and other demihumans that it can am-
bush. Its ability to alter its shape at will makes it a most danger-
ous foe.

The jackalwere can be found in any of three forms, showing no
preference for any one over the others. The first of these is that of
anormal jackal. In this form it will often run and hunt with jackal
packs. Its second form is a six foot tall, half-human/half-jackal
hybrid which stands erect. In its third form, the jackalwere is
physically indistinguishable from normal human beings. The ex-
act physical characteristics of the jackalwere’s human form varies
according to the desires of the monster.

Combat: In its jackal form, the monster conforms to the statis-
tics presented elsewhere in this volume. A careful observer, how-
ever, will find that the creature does not act in the manner typical
of a normal jackal, for it is far more aggressive.

In its hybrid form, the jackalwere can attack with either its bite
or with any weapons in hand. Because it has a great thirst for the
blood of humans and demihumans, the jackalwere will use its bite
whenever possible. Still, it will not avoid the use of weapons that
will insure its victory in combat.

In its human form, the jackalwere can only attack with weap-
ons. Although it may employ any manner of weapon, it greatly
enjoys those which will cut and tear the flesh of its victims. In
some cases, a jackalwere has been known to feed on the bodies of
fallen enemies without reverting to its jackal or hybrid form.

In all forms, the jackalwere possesses a magical gaze. If an un-
suspecting victim meets the monster's gaze, the victim must save
versus spell or fall deeply asleep; the effect is identical to that of
the sleep spell. Note that hostile, scared, or excited people are not
considered to be unsuspecting.

The jackalwere's special defenses also function in all three
forms. Only +1 or better magical weapons or those forged from
cold iron will cause any damage to the jackalwere. Jackalweres
revert to their jackal form after death.

Habitat/Society: When the jackalwere locates a victim it will as-
sume its human shape and approach its prey. It will seek to ease
the suspicions of its target, often pretending to be injured or oth-

 

 

 

 

 

erwise in need, until it can employ its gaze attack. If this fails and
the jackalwere is confronted with forceful resistance it will decide
whether to flee or press the attack based on its estimation of its
victim's strength.

The jackalwere spends its life hunting and killing those humans
and demihumans which it comes across. They roam the world in
either the jackal or human forms, seeking humanoids to kill, eat,
and rob, They are sly creatures and masters of deceit.

Jackalweres are able to mate only in their jackal form. They
may produce offspring either by mating with true jackals or other
jackalweres, but only those young who were not of mixed blood
will be jackalweres themselves. The children of a jackal and
jackalwere mating will be jackals, although they will be unnatu-
rally aggressive.

Female jackalweres give birth in five months to a litter of 1-4
pups. These are identical to jackal pups although they initially
have 1 Hit Die. The pups grow quickly and add an additional Hit
Die each year. Their jackal forms reach full growth at three years
and pups are locked in that form for their first two years. At age
two they gain the ability to assume their hybrid form and at age
three they gain the ability to assume a human form which is ap-
parently nine years of age. The human form grows at triple the
normal human rate. If a parent in human form is discovered with
its pups, it will often try to pass them off as pets.

Jackalweres may (20%) travel in the company of 1-6 normal
jackals. Although these jackals are normal in every regard, the in-
fluence of the jackalwere tends to make them more fierce than
normal. Jackals under the influence of a jackalwere will be
hunters instead of scavengers.

Ecology: Jackalweres will not serve any but the most evil of hu-
manoids, and even then only if they have the opportunity to slay
more humans and demihumans than they could on their own.

Kobolds are a cowardly, sadistic race of short humanoids that
vigorously contest the human and demi-human races for living
space and food. They especially dislike gnomes whom they will
attack on sight and in preference to all other enemies.

Barely clearing three feet in height, kobolds have scaly hides
that range from very dark rusty brown to a rusty black. They
smell like a cross between damp dogs and stagnant water. Their
eyes glow like a bright red spark and they have two small horns
ranging from tan to white. Because of the kobolds’ fondness for
wearing raggedy garb of red and orange, their non-prehensile rat-
like tails and their language (which sounds like small dogs yap-
ping), these fell creatures are often not taken seriously by
humans. This is often a fatal mistake, for what they lack in size
and strength they make up in ferocity and tenacity.

Kobolds speak their own language and can often (75%) speak
orc and goblin.

Combat: The kobold approach to combat centers around over-
whelming odds or trickery. Kobolds will attack gnomes on sight
due to their racial hatred of the species but will think twice about
attacking humans, elves, or dwarves unless the kobolds outnum-
ber them by at least two to one. They often hurl javelins and
spears, preferring not to close until they see that their enemies
have been weakened.

When they finally decide to get involved in melee combat, they
tend to attack in overwhelming waves. Should the kobolds find
themselves reduced to only a three to two or less ratio in their fa-
vor they must make a morale check. It should be noted that ko-
bolds are wary of spellcasters and will aim for them when
possible. A swarm of kobolds can often overwhelm and drag
down opponents much larger than themselves.

This diminutive race also enjoys setting up concealed pits with
spikes, crossbows, and other mechanical traps. They usually
have view ports and murder holes near these traps so that they
can follow them up by pouring flaming oil, firing missile weapons
or dropping poisonous insects on their victims.

Kobold war bands are armed with spiked clubs, axes, javelins,
short swords and spears. Their shields are seldom made of metal,
but are normally crafted of wood or made of wicker. Chiefs and
guards will tend to have the best weapons available to a tribe.

Kobolds have 60’ infravision but do not see well in bright sun-
light, suffering a —1 on their attack rolls.

   

 

  

 

 

 

Habitat/Society: Kobolds live in dark, damp places under-
ground and in overgrown forests. They can be found in almost
any climate. As kobolds are good miners, any area with potential
for mining is fair game for settlement.

The average kobold tribe has 40 - 400 (4d10x10) adult males.
For every 40 such kobolds in a band there will be one leader and
two bodyguards (AC 6; HD 1-1; hp 4 each; damage 1-6). If en-
countered in their lair there will be 5-20 (5d4) bodyguards, fe-
males equal to 50% of the males, young equal to 10% of the
males and 30-300 (3d10x10) eggs. There will also be a chief and 2-
8 guards (AC 5; HD 1+1; hp 7 each; damage 1-8) in the lair. Fur-
ther, there is a 65% chance there will be guard animals: (70%) 2-5
wild boars (AC 7; HD 3 +3; damage 3d4 gore) or (30%) 1-4 giant
weasels (AC 6; HD 3+3; damage 2d6 bite and blood drain).
There may be also one or more tribal shamans.

Their society is tribal but can be further broken up into war
bands based on specific clans. As many as ten families can be part
of a clan, and each clan usually is responsible for controlling the
area ina ten mile radius from the lair. From this area, the kobolds
forage for plants, hunt for meat, and waylay humans and demi-
humans. Kobolds recover treasure from the bodies of their vic-
tims and often carry them back to their lair as food. In some
instances, kobolds will not kill their victims, but will sell them as
slaves, though this happens only if they are close to an area which
has a market for such wares.

Kobolds are distrustful of strangers. They especially hate
brownies, pixies, sprites and gnomes, the latter being attacked on
sight. Gnomes are never eaten or taken prisoner.

Kobolds live to conquer land and strip it of all its resources,
gathering as much power as possible in the process. Because of
this, they often come into conflict with gnomes, who compete
with kobolds for the same living spaces and mining rights. They
hate most other life and delight in killing and torture.

Ecology: Perhaps kobolds are so cruel because they, being so
small, are easy prey for larger humanoids and hungry monsters.
They have many enemies, and even the dwarves have had to ad-
mit that at times the numerous kobold-goblin wars have kept the
number of goblins down to a safe level.

The average lifespan of the kobold is 135 years.

When wandering through the world’s sylvan forests, travelers
should be wary of music and laughter coming from a clearing.
More than likely, the cause is the dance-loving korred, a race that
is close to nature and jealously protects its way of life.

Perhaps the most striking feature of this gnome-sized race of
humanoids is their wildly flowing beards and hair, which seem to
snake out in all directions. Their bodies are hairy, with their
lower quarters being those of a goat. The korred wear little, usu-
ally only a pair of leather britches. Korred smell like pine trees
and fresh earth after a spring rainstorm. A stout oaken cudgel is
the favored weapon and no korred is seen without his large
leather pouches.

They speak their own language and often know the satyr,
dryad, centaur, and elf tongues. On rare occasions (10%), a
korred may be found who can speak the secret language of the
druids. Being a boisterous folk, they usually shout when they
talk.

Combat: Korred have great strength (average of 18/76) and
they use it to hurl boulders up to 100’ (damage 2d8). They also
use cudgels (damage 1d6 +4), or shears which are found in their
pouches (damage 1d4+4). Without a weapon the korred can
strike for 1 or 2 points of damage, while its great strength adds
+4 to this total.

They can trap intruders by weaving their hair into animated
entangling ropes and snares in 1-4 rounds. Such ropes are AC 1,
have 5 hit points, and a movement rate of 3. Anyone attacked by
the rope must save versus paralysis or become entangled. Some-
times a band of korred will leave these entangling strands of hair
around the perimeter of their party glen as this enables them to
turn their full attention away from such mundane tasks as guard
duty and focus their attention on truly worthwhile (to a korred)
pursuits like dancing and singing.

Korred may employ their magical laugh up to three times a
day. Anyone within 60' of them must roll his charisma or higher
on a d20 or be stunned for 1-4 rounds. Note that a bard's singing
can nullify this effect.

In addition to their laugh, korred can use the following abilities
at will: stone shape, animate rock, stone door (teleport 30’), shat-
ter rock, transmute rock to mud and stone tell.

    

 

  

 

 

 

Habitat/Society: Wooded hills and sylvan settings are favored
by the korred, who usually lair in caves or burrows. The korred
are clannish, using the word “clan” as a title (for example, Clan
Korefyr). In keeping with their chaotic nature, they do not have
structured communities. Typically, there are 1-4 adults and 2-8
(2d4) children per family, with 2-8 (2d4) families being part of
each individual clan. These families are scattered throughout an
area of roughly five miles.

In respect of nature, korred are mostly herbivores, though at
times they are known to indulge in some game, especially if plants
are scarce, as is the case during winter. Korred are reclusive and
do not tolerate outsiders, the only possible exception being rang-
ers, druids, and elves. Even then, the stranger must be sure not to
interrupt a korred celebration or dance. Satyrs are well-received
by korred, and it is not unusual to see a celebration with korred,
satyrs and dryads.

Each week the korred have a holiday where they dance and
play music using pipes, drums and harps. Those who interrupt
the dance must save versus spell or dance themselves, losing 1-4
hit points per round until they are dead, restrained, or the korred
flee.

The korred pouches contain hair (for weaving their ropes),
shears, and other items. These items will turn to gold if sprinkled
with holy water (5d4 x 10gp value). No korred will voluntarily
give up this pouch.

There is much debate among sages and scholars as to the
korred’s purpose in life. It seems to be to dance, sing, celebrate,
and build strange things out of stone. They are rumored to have
built the druid stone circles. They love nature and freedom and
often take it upon themselves to preserve both if threatened.

Ecology: This magical race is sought out for the creation of sev-
eral magical items. Their hair is a key ingredient for ropes of en-
tangling and nets of snaring. The fermented fruit beverages which
the korred consume can also be used as a component for love
philters and potions of human control.

The lich is, perhaps, the single most powerful form of undead
known to exist. They seek to further their own power at all costs
and have little or no interest in the affairs of the living, except
where those affairs interfere with their own.

A lich greatly resembles a wight or mummy, being gaunt and
skeletal in form. The creature's eye sockets are black and empty
save for the fierce pinpoints of light which serve the lich as eyes.
The lich can see with normal vision in even the darkest of envi-
ronments but is unaffected by even the brightest light. An aura of
cold and darkness radiates from the lich which makes it an omi-
nous and fearsome sight. They were originally wizards or priests
of at least 18th level.

Liches are often (75%) garbed in the rich clothes of nobility. If
not so attired, the lich will be found in the robes of its former pro-
fession. In either case, the clothes will be tattered and rotting with
a 25% chance of being magical in some way.

Combat: Although a lich will seldom engage in actual melee
combat with those it considers enemies, it is more than capable of
holding its own when forced into battle.

The aura of magical power which surrounds a lich is so potent
that any creature of fewer than 5 Hit Dice (or Sth level) which sees
it must save versus spell or flee in terror for 5-20 (Sd4) rounds.

Should the lich elect to touch a living creature, its aura of abso-
lute cold will inflict 1-10 points of damage. Further, the victim
must save versus paralysis or be utterly unable to move. This pa-
ralysis lasts until dispelled in some manner.

Liches can themselves be hit only by weapons of at least +1, by
magical spells, or by monsters with 6 or more Hit Dice and/or
magical properties. The magical nature of the lich and its undead
state make it utterly immune to charm, sleep, enfeeblement, poly-
morph, cold, electricity, insanity, or death spells. Priests of at
least 8th level can attempt to turn a lich, as can paladins of no less
than 10th level.

Alich is able to employ spells just as it did in life. It still requires
the use of its spell books, magical components, and similar ob-
jects. It is important to note that most, if not all, liches have had a
great deal of time in which to research and create new magical
spells and objects. Thus, adventurers should be prepared to face
magics the likes of which they have never seen before when stalk-

 

ing a lich. In addition, liches are able to use any magical objects
which they might possess just as if they were still alive.

Defeating a lich in combat is difficult indeed, but managing to
actually destroy the creature is harder still. In all cases, a lich will
protect itself from annihilation with the creation of a phylactery
in which it stores its life force. This is similar to a magic jar spell.
In order to ensure the final destruction of a lich, its body must be
wholly annihilated and its phylactery must be sought out and de-
stroyed in some manner. Since the lich will always take great care
to see to it that its phylactery is well hidden and protected this can
be an undertaking fully as daunting as the defeat of the lich in its
physical form.

Habitat/Society: Liches are usually solitary creatures. They
have cast aside their places as living beings by choice and now
want as little to do with the world of men as possible. From time
to time, however, a lich’s interest in the world at large may be rea-
wakened by some great event of personal importance.

A lich will make its home in some ominous fortified area, often
a strong keep or vast subterranean crypt.

When a lich does decide to become involved with the world be-
yond its lair, its keen intelligence makes it a dangerous adversary.
In some cases, a lich will depend on its magical powers to accom-
plish its goals. If this is not sufficient, however, the lich is quite ca-
pable of animating a force of undead troops to act on its behalf. If
such is the case, the lich’s endless patience and cunning more than
make up for the inherent disadvantages of the lesser forms of un-
dead which it commands.

Although the lich has no interest in good or evil as we under-
stand it, the creature will do whatever it must to further its own
causes. Since it feels that the living are of little importance, the
lich is often viewed as evil by those who encounter it. In rare
cases, liches of a most unusual nature can be found which are of
any alignment.

The lich can exist for centuries without change. Its will drives it
onward to master new magics and harness mystical powers not
available to it in its previous life. So obsessed does the monster
become with its quest for power that it often forgets its former ex-
istence utterly. Few liches call themselves by their old names when
the years have drained the last vestiges of their humanity from
Lich

them. Instead, they often adopt pseudonyms like “the Black
Hand” or “the Forgotten King.” Learning the true name of a lich is
rumored to confer power over the creature.

Ecology: The lich is not a thing of this world. Although it was
once a living creature, it has entered into an unnatural existence.

In order to become a lich, the wizard must prepare its phylac-
tery by the use of the enchant an item, magic jar, permanency and
reincarnation spells. The phylactery, which can be almost any
manner of object, must be of the finest craftsmanship and materi-
als with a value of not less than 1,500 gold pieces per level of the
wizard. Once this object is created, the would-be lich must craft a
potion of extreme toxicity, which is then enchanted with the fol-
lowing spells: wraithform, permanency, cone of cold, feign
death, and animate dead. When next the moon is full, the potion
is imbibed. Rather than death, the potion causes the wizard to un-
dergo a transformation into its new state. A system shock sur-
vival throw is required, with failure indicating an error in the
creation of the potion which kills the wizard and renders him for-
ever dead.

Demilich

The demilich is not, as the name implies, a weaker form of the
lich. Rather, it is the stage into which a lich will eventually evolve
as the power which has sustained its physical form gradually be-
gins to fail. In most cases, all that remains of a demilich’s body are
askull, some bones, and a pile of dust.

When it has learned all that it feels it can in its undead life, the
lich will continue its quest for power in strange planes unknown
to even the wisest of sages. Since it has no use for its physical
body at this point, the lich leaves it to decay as it should have
done centuries ago.

If the final resting place of a demilich’s remains are entered, the
dust which was once its body will rise up and assume a man-like
shape. In the case of the oldest demiliches (25%), the shape will
advance and threaten, but dissipate without attacking in 3 rounds
unless attacked. Younger demiliches (75%) still retain a link to
their remains, however, and will form with the powers of a
wraith. This dust form cannot be turned. In addition, it can store
energy from attacks and use this power to engage its foes. If the
dust form is attacked, each point of damage which is delivered to
it is converted to an energy point. Since the demilich will fall back
and seem to suffer injury from each attack (though none is actu-
ally inflicted), its attackers are likely to press on in their attempts
to destroy it. Once the demilich has acquired 50 energy points, it
will assume a manifestation which looks much like the lich’s ear-
lier undead form and has the powers and abilities of a ghost, but
which cannot be turned.

If anyone touches the skull it will rise into the air and turn to
face the most powerful of the intruders (a spell user will be chosen
over a non-spell user). Instantly, it unleashes a howl which acts as
adeath ray, affecting all creatures within a 20' radius of the skull.
Those who fail to save versus spell are permanently dead.

On the next round, the demilich will employ another manner
of attack. In order to attain the status of a demilich, a lich must
have replaced 5-8 (1d4 +4) of its teeth with gems. Each of these
gems now serves as a powerful magical device which can trap the
soul of its adversaries. The physical body of someone hit with the
demilich’s spell collapses and rots away ina single round. Once it
has drained the life essence from the most powerful member of
the party, the skull sinks back to the floor. If it continues to be
challenged, the demilich can repeat this attack until all of its gems
are filled. An amulet of life protection will prevail over the gem,
but the character's body will perish regardless.

In addition to the attacks mentioned above, a demilich can also
pronounce a powerful curse on those who disturb it. These can be

so mighty as to include: always being hit by one’s enemies, never
making a saving throw, or the inability to acquire new experience
points. Demilich curses can be overcome with a remove curse,
but the victim loses one point of charisma permanently when the
curse is removed.

The skull of a demilich is Armor Class —6 and has S50 hit
points. It can be affected by spells in only a few ways: a forget
spell will cause it to sink down without attacking (either by howl-
ing or draining a soul), a dispel evil will do 5-8 (1d4 +4) points of
damage to it, a shatter spell will inflict 3-18 (3d6) points of dam-
age to it, a holy word pronounced against it will deliver 5-30 (5d6)
points of damage, and a power word kill spell cast by an ethereal
or astral wizard will cause the skull to shatter (destroying it).

Most weapons will be unable to harm the skull of a demilich,
but there are exceptions. A fighter or ranger with a vorpal sword,
sword of sharpness, sword +5, or vorpal weapon can inflict nor-
mal damage on the skull, as can a paladin with a vorpal or +4
weapon. Further, any character with a +4 or better weapon or a
mace of disruption can inflict 1 point of damage to the skull each
time he strikes it.

Upon the destruction of the skull, those who have been trapped
inside the gems must make a saving throw versus spell. Those
who fail are lost forever, having been consumed by the demilich
to power its magical nature. If the character survives, the gem
glows with a faint inner light, and true seeing will reveal a tiny
figure trapped within. If the throw is made the soul can be freed
by simply crushing the gem. A new body must be within 10 yards
for the soul to enter or it will be lost. Such a body might be a clone
or simulacrum. (See spells of those names.)

If the fragments of the destroyed skull are not destroyed by im-
mersion in holy water and the casting of a dispel magic the demi-
lich will reform in 1-10 days.

Fire Lizards

Fire lizards resemble wingless red dragons and are sometimes called “false
dragons.” They are gray-colored with mottled red and brown back and
reddish undersides. Hatchlings are light gray in color and darken as they
age.

Combat: Fire lizards attack with a combination of raking claws and
bite. They can simultaneously breathe a fiery cone 5 feet wide at the
mouth, 10 feet wide at the end, and 15 feet long which inflicts 2-12 points
of fire-based damage (half if saving throw versus breath weapon is made).
Fire lizards are immune to fire-based attacks.

Habitat/Society: Fire lizards prefer subterranean lairs but come out
every fortnight to hunt fresh game. Prey is hauled back to the lair for a lei-
surely meal; the debris forms the treasure trove. Fire lizards are slow mov-

ing and sleep 50% of the time. Their lairs may have 1-4 eggs (10% chance,
market value 5,000 gp each). Hatchlings immediately leave to hunt on
their own. Shiny objects attract fire lizards; gems and metals form the
bulk of treasure found in their dens.

Ecology: Fire lizards are perhaps an ancestral dragon type or offshoot of
acommon ancestor. Real dragons avoid these “false dragons,’ which grow
to be 50-100 years old. Fire lizard eggs are worth 5,000 gp, hatchlings
7,500 gp.

Giant Lizards

This lizard is relatively normal, albeit large, and lives in marshes and
swamps. An attack score of 20 means the giant lizard's victim is trapped in
the mouth and suffers double damage (2-16 points). The giant lizard in-
flicts 2-16 points of damage each round thereafter. Giant lizards are lazy
hunters and tend to attack anything edible that wanders by. While their
great size protects them from most predators, it renders them a sumptu-
ous feast to the black dragons who share their swamps. Giant lizards are
sometimes domesticated by lizard men, who use them as mounts, beasts
of burden, and food. Their lairs may be home to a wide range of lizards,
from eggs to century-old adults.

Minotaur Lizards

This huge, aggressive lizard derives its name from its horns. While these
horns look like those of a minotaur, the male's horns are not used in
combat—rather, they are believed to be a means of attracting a mate. The
minotaur lizard attacks with sharp claws and teeth. They are adept at am-
bushes; others are -5 on their surprise roll. An attack roll of 20 means the
lizard has trapped its victim within its jaws and can automatically inflict
3-18 points of damage each round thereafter until the victim escapes or
dies. The victim is unable to attack the following round. Minotaur lizards
are found in tropical hills and mountains near copper and red dragons.

Subterranean Lizards

This aggressive lizard is able to run across walls or ceilings with the help of
its suction cup-tipped feet. An attack roll of 20 means the lizard has
clamped its jaws on its victim and does double damage (4-24 points). The
victim automatically suffers an additional 2-12 points of damage each
round thereafter. These lizards never leave their caves voluntarily. Some
species are albino; these shun light and attack at -1 in daylight or its equiv-
alent. Other species have tongues up to 20 feet long. Any man-sized or
smaller prey seized by the tongue will be drawn into the mouth and bitten
the next round unless a bend bars roll is made.

Lizard men are savage, semi-aquatic, reptilian humanoids that
live through scavenging, raiding, and, in less hostile areas, by
fishing and gathering.

Adult lizard men stand 6 to 7 feet tall, weighing 200 to 250
pounds. Skin tones range from dark green to gray to brown, and
their scales give them a flecked appearance. Their tails average 3
to 4 feet long and are not prehensile. Males are nearly impossible
to distinguish from females without close inspection. Lizard man
garb is limited to strings of bones and other barbaric ornament.
Lizard men speak their own language.

Combat: In combat, lizard men fight as unorganized individ-
uals. If they have equality or an advantage over their opponents,
they tend toward frontal assaults and massed rushes. When out-
numbered, overmatched, or on their home ground, however,
they become wily and ferocious opponents. Snares, sudden am-
bushes, and spoiling raids are favored tactics in these situations.
While individually savage in melee, lizard men tend to be dis-
tracted by food (such as slain opponents) and by simple treasures,
which may allow some of their quarry to escape. They occasion-
ally take prisoners as slaves, for food, or to sacrifice in obscure
tribal rites.

For every 10 lizard men encountered, there will be one patrol
leader with maximum hit points (17 hp) and a 50% chance for a
shaman with 3 Hit Dice and the abilities of a 3rd-level priest. If
one or more tribes are encountered, each tribe will also have a
war leader of 6 Hit Dice, two subleaders with 4 Hit Dice, and a
shaman of either 4 or 5 hit Dice (50% chance of each), Any group
of two or more tribes has a 50% chance for an additional shaman
of 7 Hit Dice. Furthermore, each such group has a cumulative
10% chance per tribe to be led by a lizard king. If a lizard king is
present, a shaman of 7 Hit Dice will always be present, and all pa-
trol leaders from each tribe (i.e., 10% of the male warriors) will
be combined into a single fanatical bodyguard for the lizard king.

 

 

 

 

 

Habitat/Society: Lizard men are typically found in swamps,
marshes, and similar places, often (35%) dwelling totally under-
water in air-filled caves. A tribe rarely numbers more than 150 in-
dividuals, including females and hatchlings. It is not uncommon
for several tribes in an area to forge an informal alliance against
outsiders, including other lizard man tribes.

Lizard men are omnivorous, but are likely to prefer human
flesh to other foods. In this regard they have been known to am-
bush humans, gather up the corpses and capture the survivors,
and take the lot back to their lair for a rude and horrid feast.

Ecology: Lizard men have few natural enemies. They prey on
human, demihuman, or humanoid settlements if these are
nearby. Lizard man eggs are bitter and inedible, as is their flesh,
but their skin is sometimes worked as scale armor (Armor Class
6). Lizard men produce no art, artifacts, or trade goods.

Advanced Lizard Men

About 1 tribe in 10 has evolved to a higher state. These lizard men
dwell in crude huts, use shields (thus Armor Class 4) and hurl
barbed darts (30 yard range, 1-4 points damage) or javelins (1-6
points damage) before closing with the enemy. These lizard men
use clubs (treat as morning stars, 2-8 points damage), and the
leaders may use captured swords or other weaponry. The chance
of these advanced lizard men having a lizard king is doubled, i.e.,
20% cumulative chance per tribe.

Lizard King

A lizard king is a lizard man of above average height and intelli-
gence, leading one or more loosely organized tribes of lizard men.
The lizard king is most often armed with a great trident, which it
wields with great skill and ferocity. In the hands of the lizard king,
the weapon inflicts 5-20 (3d6 +2) points of damage. If the attack
roll is 5 or more greater than the score needed to hit, the lizard
king inflicts double damage (with a minimum of 15 points).

A lizard king usually demands two humans each week. If no
humans are available, demihumans and other humanoids will be
sought. If none are available, two of the lizard king’s bodyguards
will be killed and eaten instead.

Lycanthrope, General

 

Lycanthropes are humans who can transform themselves to re-
semble normal animals or monsters. A distinction must be
made between true lycanthropes (those to whom lycanthropy
is a genetic trait) and infected lycanthropes (those whose ly-
canthropy resulted from being wounded by a true lycan-
thrope).

Description: Most lycanthropes have two forms; some have
three. The first is the natural humanoid form, which over time
becomes more and more reminiscent of the lycanthrope’s ani-
mal form. The second form is a hybrid, combining both ani-
mal and humanoid features; the size of this hybrid tends to be
that of the creature imitated. The third form is identical to that
of a normal creature of the imitated species; the only visual
clue is that the eyes may glow in the dark. A slain lycanthrope
always reverts to its natural humanoid form within one round.

Although the forms of attack vary with each species, all true
lycanthropes can transmit their dreadful affliction. Any hu-
manoid creature injured by a lycanthrope but not actually
killed (and presumably eaten) has a chance to contract lycan-
thropy. This chance equals 1% per point of damage caused by
the lycanthrope. Thus, if a character suffers 24 points of dam-
age from a true werewolf, he has a 24% chance of becoming a
werewolf himself. If the character eats belladonna within an
hour of the attack, there is a 25% chance that this will cure the
affliction (it definitely incapacitates the character for one to
four days). The only other way to lift the affliction is if a re-
move curse spell is cast on the character on the night of a full
moon or the night immediately preceding or following a full
moon. If the character makes a successful saving throw vs.
polymorph, the curse is broken. Otherwise, the change takes
place and the spell has no effect. Cure disease spells and other
powers have no effect against this affliction.

Only infected lycanthropes can be cured. To a true lycan-
thrope, lycanthropy is as natural as breathing, and the condi-
tion cannot be altered. True lycanthropes have complete
control over their physical states; they are not affected by
darkness, phases of the moon, or any of the other situations
which traditionally affect infected lycanthropes.

Combat: In human form, the lycanthrope uses a weapon to
attack.

In the lycanthrope form, the monster can be struck only by
silver or magical weapons. Wounds from any other source
heal too quickly to cause actual damage.

In determining the damage and attacks of an unknown ly-
canthropic species use the imitated creature as a guide. Lycan-
thropes usually do at least as much damage as a normal
creature of that type. They may have additional attacks or
damage as well.

Habitat/Society: True lycanthropes can change shape at will,
regardless of the time of day or phase of the moon. Infected ly-
canthropes are usually humanoid during the day. When dark-
ness falls on a night of a full moon, or the night directly
preceding or following a full moon, the infected lycanthrope
changes shape against his will and is overcome by bloodlust.
During this time, an infected PC is beyond the player's con-
trol; the DM takes over the character. The character's Strength
increases temporarily to 19. His Armor Class, number of at-
tacks, movement, and immunities are identical to those of the
type of lycanthrope that wounded him. The character wants
only to hunt and kill, and usually selects either personal
friends or enemies as his victims (the werecreature makes no
distinction between friends and enemies; all that matters is the
strength of the love—or hate—binding them).

When the character returns to his normal form, he heals
10% to 60% (1d6 x 10) of any wounds he suffered in animal
form. He also has hazy, haunting memories of performing ter-
rible acts.

Each type of true lycanthrope has its own language as well
as its humanoid language; some may be able to speak the lan-
guages used by the animals they imitate.

True lycanthropes tend to avoid human society unless at-
tacking or on an errand. Lycanthropes travel alone or in small
packs. These packs are usually of similar lycanthropes but
may also include normal animals or monsters whom the lycan-
thropes resemble. Some lycanthropes have the ability to sum-
mon such creatures.

Ecology: Lycanthropes fit a variety of roles, depending on
the type of creature they become. There are five major species
of lycanthropes; these are covered on the following pages.

Werebears are humans who can transform themselves into large
brown bears. They are the best known good-aligned lycan-
thropes. The ursine form most often resembles a brown bear.
Some have blond, reddish, black, or ivory fur (the latter is com-
mon in frozen regions).

In human form they are large, stout, well-muscled, and hairy.
Their brown hair is thick; males usually wear beards. Some have
reddish, blond, ivory, or black hair; this matches the color of the
ursine form. They dress in simple cloth and leather garments that
are easily removed, repaired, or replaced.

Combat; In human form, the werebear uses available weapons,
preferring axes, spears, and knives, since these have practical ap-
plications suitable for woodland life. If attacked in daylight, the
werebear usually remains human unless death is likely. The
shapechange renders the werebear helpless for a round. In ursine
form, the werebear attacks with two swiping claws and a bite. If
both claws hit, during the next round the werebear can hug for an
additional 2-16 points of damage. This subsequent damage con-
tinues automatically each round thereafter.

Like those of other lycanthropes, the werebear’s defenses func-
tion only in the bear form. Weapons used against the werebear
must be either silver or magical weapons of +1 or better. Were-
bears can summon 1-6 brown bears within 2-12 turns, provided
such animals are within one mile. Werebears heal at three times
the normal human rate and can cure disease in another creature in
1-4 weeks if they so desire.

If a werebear dies, he reverts to his human form in one round.

Habitat/Society: Werebears are normally solitary creatures. As
humans, hey build cabins far from settled areas, preferably in a
deep forest near well-stocked waters. Werebears do not marry al-
though they may have preferred mates they meet on a very irreg-
ular basis. Females bear 1-2 children in human form. Such
children are very stout and grow quickly. Within eight years they
gain adolescence and the ability to change into werebears.
Shortly after, the mother drives the children out and seeks a mate
to start the cycle anew. The newly independent young are dis-
creetly guided and assisted by older werebears. Despite their ap-
parent isolationism and rugged individualism, werebears have a
sense of community. They never attack each other and aid any
werebear threatened by another lycanthrope species.

   
 

 

 

 

 

Werebears are closest to forest-dwelling classes like rangers,
druids, and wildlife-oriented priests. They rarely enter villages
and never enter cities except in dire emergencies or to help other
good-aligned people, especially those threatened by evil lycan-
thropes. Werebears hate wererats and werewolves.

The average werebear claims a territory 1 to 4 square miles in
size. Fishing areas are open to all werebears. A werebear feels a
close bond to its home region, acting as a game warden to protect
its territory and the animals therein from the ravages of intruders.

Werebears do not travel a great deal. Only the rare individual
(usually young) can be coaxed into joining a band of adventurers.
Werebears may join an adventuring group as guides, provided
the money is right and the job is agreeable.

Treasure is usually limited to small, valuable commodities like
gold, platinum, gems, and jewelry. Werebears rarely carry any
treasure and instead hide it near their homes. They also collect
scrolls, potions, and other magical items, often as fees or rewards
for past services. Werebears destroy any magical items that spe-
cifically affect lycanthropes or bears, since such items might be
used against themselves.

Ecology: Werebears are omnivorous, preferring fish, small
mammals, and a honey-rich mead. This mead is extremely intoxi-
cating to normal humans. Werebears have few natural enemies.
Their closest enemies are the werewolves who share their prefer-
red wilderness regions.

Wererats, also called ratmen, are humans who can transform
themselves into three forms—human, human-sized ratman, and
giant rat. They are sly and evil, and usually inhabit tunnel com-
plexes beneath cities.

The wererat’s human form tends to be a thin, wiry individual of
shorter than average height. His eyes constantly dart around, and
his nose and mouth may twitch if he is excited. Males often have
thin, ragged moustaches,

The ratman form is somewhat shorter than the human form.
The head, torso, and tail are identical to those of a rat, but the
limbs remain human.

The third form is that of a giant rat 2 feet from nose to rump.
This form is identical to that of the giant rat (q.v.). This is the pre-
ferred form for travel and spying on potential victims.

Wererats are often followed by 1-6 mice or rats that are instinc-
tively drawn to them but are not controlled by them.

Combat: In all three forms, wererats rely on weapons for their
attacks, preferring shortswords and daggers. Anyone who is in-
jured by a true wererat has a 1% chance per point of damage of
becoming a wererat. In their ratman and giant rat forms, wererats
can be hurt only by silver or magical weapons.

Wererats prefer to attack from ambush. A favorite tactic is to
assume human shape and lure unsuspecting victims into a trap.
This is the only time wererats are voluntarily alone. Victims are
then robbed, held for ransom, or eaten.

Each wererat is able to summon and control 2-12 giant rats.

Habitat/Society: Wererats live in packs, regardless of form,
never being alone if they can help it. Solitary wererats are either
sole survivors or engaged in mischief. They do not form interper-
sonal bonds like love or marriage. In fact, wererats rarely mate
with their own kind. Offspring of a wererat and human woman
are human, although they are small like their father. Offspring of
a female wererat resemble giant rats with human-like paws.
These ratlings grow to maturity in two years and gain the ability
to transform themselves into human children with an apparent
age about three times that of the ratling’s actual age.

Wererats prefer subterranean lairs hidden among the sewers
and catacombs beneath cities. Nothing can pass through the
sewers and escape their attention. Unfortunately for the wererat,
the sewer's stains and smells do not vanish when it assumes hu-

 

 

 

 

 

man form. This effectively limits wererats to the less savory sec-
tions of town as well as cutting down on the number of humans
who might unknowingly mate with a wererat.

Wererats see cities as their hunting grounds. They delight in
matching their superior intellects and meager physical skills
against the more powerful and numerous humans. But they are
no fools; they will not attack unless they are sure they can win. If
a battle is going against them, wererats will scatter, transform to
rat form, and head for the sanctuary of the sewers. They won't
even defend their own lairs. Their attitude is that since they had
stolen most of their belongings in the first place, they can always
replace them.

Wererats are greedy and collect anything they think might have
worth. The resulting trove usually has more junk than treasure,
but a thorough search may reveal a wide variety of valuables.

Wererats frequent sleazy taverns, both for the cheap alcohol
and to follow drunks into the streets to drag them away for the
next day's meal.

Ecology: Wererats are parasites. They recognize that they are
physically weaker than most species that dominate the surface.
They have found and exploited the one niche where they have a
chance to dominate, the world beneath the cities. They feed on
humans and steal their riches. Humans unknowingly protect the
wererats from both surface dwelling creatures and those who
might burrow up from far below. Besides, the humans pay for the
upkeep of the wererat's sewer realm.

Psychologically, wererats remind humans that no matter how
strongly defended they think they are, monsters can still get in.
Mothers describe wererats as bogeymen to scare unruly children.

The seawolves are humans who can assume a form combining as-
pects of a seal and a wolf. Their packs roam the seas in search of
ships to attack.

The monstrous form of the lesser seawolf has the 6 to 7 foot long
body of a seal. The head and shoulders are those of a wolf. In human
form the lesser seawolves stand 5 to 6 feet tall. All are thickly muscled
and have tiny ears and long hair that covers their head and shoulders
like a mane, The lesser seawolf has a hybrid form of a wolfman, a hu-
manoid shape that retains the seawolf’s teeth, claws, and fur; statistics
for this form are given in parentheses above.

Combat: Lesser seawolves approach a ship in seawolf form, then
change into the hybrid form and climb aboard. There they use their
teeth and claws to kill their opponents. If the ship looks too heavily
defended, the seawolves may gnaw holes in the hull in order to sink
the ship.

Unlike most other lycanthropes, lesser seawolves have no special
protection against normal weapons. Dead seawolves revert to their
human form in a single round.

Habitat/Society: Most seawolves were formerly fishermen or sail-
ors; as such, they also tend to be male and human. They travel in
packs with those of their own kind, Their fierce hatred of their former
coworkers drives them to seek to kill them or pass on the lycanthropic
curse. Victims who acquire the disease become seawolves in 2-5 days.
Once night falls, the new seawolf slips into the water and goes off in
search of a pack.

Seawolves are nomads constantly roaming the cooler sections of
the seas. They neither build lairs nor keep treasure. During the day,
they sleep on beaches or in caves or appropriated houses. If surprised
on a beach, they pretend to be shipwreck victims, then kill the in-
truders and take their clothing. If at sea, the seawolves are still able to
sleep during the day by floating on their backs; in this case they may
be mistaken for a cluster of drowning victims. If a ship moves close to
investigate, the seawolves wait for the best opportunity to attack and
take over the ship.

Seawolves breathe air. They can remain submerged for 17-24
(1d8 +16) minutes. Failure to surface after that time causes them to
suffer 1-6 points of damage each round until they drown.

Female seawolves give birth to single cubs. These may appear to be
human infants during the day or baby seals at night. Seawolves lack

 

 

 

 

 

parental feelings and abandon the cubs. Although the cubs are able to
swim and hunt from birth, they have difficulty keeping up with adults
and often drown during the day if they are at sea. Only 5% of cubs
reach adulthood, The offspring of a seawolf and a human are good
swimmers who feel mysteriously drawn to the sea, but few (25%) be-
come seawolves upon reaching adolescence.

Seawolves may ally themselves with other evil aquatic lycan-
thropes. They hate selkies, whom they consider allies of the human-
oids. Lesser seawolves attack selkies on sight.

Their diet includes a variety of foods, such as shellfish, fish, sea-
birds, sea mammals, and anyone they can sink their teeth into. Occa-
sionally packs may wander into a town and take over a tavern for a
round of drinking and wenching.

Seawolf personalities are a twisted version of their original, human
personalities. It is as if the seawolf persona is a savage, magnified ver-
sion of all the original person's bad traits. Seawolves periodically re-
turn to their original home port. This may be a subconscious longing
for their old life or a means to renew their hatred of those still human-
oid, If a seawolf spots his old self's mate or child, he may attempt to
make contact.

Ecology: Seawolves are the sworn enemies of any humanoid who
makes his living in the sea. They live to destroy shipping, spread ter-
ror, and spread their curse further.

Greater Seawolves

The monstrous form of the greater seawolf has a 12 to 15 foot long
body, but is otherwise identical to the lesser seawolf. In human form,
greater seawolves stand 6 to 7 feet tall.

Combat; Greater seawolves assume their human forms to get close
to their opponents. The typical plan is to bite or strangle one or two
deckhands, take their weapons, and begin a general assault.

In seawolf form, greater seawolves can be harmed only by silver,
cold iron, or magical weapons of +1 or better. Steel weapons have no
effect. Dead seawolves revert to their human form in one round.

Weretigers are humans, usually female, that have the ability to
transform into tigerlike forms. They have a strong affinity for all
felines.

The human form tends to be sleekly muscular, taller than aver-
age, and very agile. The voices of weretigers are husky and they
tend to roll their r's,

The weretiger form is a hybrid between a human and a tiger. It
is about 25% larger than the human form, and is covered by tiger-
striped hide. A 3-foot tail extends from the spine. The legs are
more feline than human; this form walks on its toes. The head is
also a mixture of features. The ears, nose, muzzle, and teeth are
tigerlike, but the eyes and overall shape are human. If the human
form's hair is long, it is still present. The fingernails grow into
claws. Despite the changes, the hybrid form can pass for human
at a distance if properly disguised.

The third form is that of a fully grown tiger without any trace
of human features.

Weretigers speak the languages of all feline breeds, so normal
felines, including the great cats, have a 75% chance of being
friendly toward a weretiger. Even feline monsters have a 25%
chance of being automatically friendly. However, weretigers are
rarely found in the company of real tigers, being only 5% likely
to be accompanied by them.

Combat: In either tiger form, the weretiger attacks with a vari-
ety of punches, raking claws, and bites. The weretiger’s punches
are so strong that they cause 1-4 points of damage. Otherwise the
claws can be raked across an opponent, causing 2-5 points of
damage. The teeth are the most dreadful weapon. They can tear a
victim apart or crush a windpipe. Weretigers usually bite only in
their full tiger form.

In human form, the weretiger uses a wide variety of weapons
with which it is adept. A weretiger is also good at unarmed com-
bat; it retains its deadly punch in this form, as well as an en-
hanced sense of smell and night vision.

Habitat/Society: For various reasons weretigresses outnumber
weretigers five to one.

Weretigers travel alone or in small prides. They do not marry
but have preferred mates, which may be either humans or tigers.
Weretigers give birth to one or two cubs. The cubs are the hybrid
form; they look like fuzzy human babies with tails. Cubs mature

    

  

 

 

 

quickly. They can crawl within days, walk within a month, and
hunt within a year. Their physical size matches that of a human
child of three times the same age. At age six, they reach adoles-
cence and gain the ability to transform into a fully human form.
At age 12, they gain the ability to assume a full-tiger form; this is
considered the mark of adulthood.

If a male weretiger mates with either a real tigress or human
woman, the offspring initially has the same appearance as the
mother. Lycanthropic transformations do not begin until the hy-
brid reaches adolescence.

Weretigers are omnivorous. In the wild they roam a territory of
7-10 (1d4 +6) square miles. Their homes are usually near human
settlements. These tend to be well kept cabins with small herb and
vegetable gardens. The only livestock will be a variety of cats and
some poultry.

Weretigers rarely live in confined settings such as cities or large
towns because their lycanthropic nature would be hard to con-
ceal. If found in such a setting, one or two weretigers in human
form will be on an errand, such as a mission, a revel, or a simple
shopping trip. In any form, weretigers are very confident and not
prone to attack unless provoked.

Treasure varies widely, acquired as payment for past services,
plunder from past adventures, or scavenged from the remains of
past opponents. Weretigers have an affinity for gems and often
keep a small cache hidden somewhere near their homes.

Ecology: Weretigers are the most adaptable of the lycan-
thropes. They are equally at home in human, feline, or monster
company.

Werewolves are the most feared of the lycanthropes, men who
can transform into wolflike beasts. They should not be confused
with wolfweres (q.v.)—wolves who turn into men. Great enmity
exists between werewolves and wolfweres.

The human forms of werewolves have no distinguishing traits.
The werewolf form is equally varied. Many have a bipedal form
that is a hybrid of human and lupine features. These creatures are
about one foot taller and stronger than their human forms, The
bodies are fur-covered and have short tails, wolflike legs, and
heads that are combinations in varying degrees of human and lu-
pine features.

A second form of hybrid is more wolflike, and may be mis-
taken for a large wolf when it runs on all four legs. This hybrid
can also walk erect and has humanlike hands.

Another type of werewolf (about 20%) looks exactly like a
large wolf about the size of a bear. This creature has no human
features, although the eyes may glow red in the dark.

Combat: In their human forms, werewolves attack with a vari-
ety of weapons, generally those common to their human identity
and class. In the werewolf or wolflike forms, the creature attacks
with its fearsome teeth. If the form has hands, the werewolf may
grab its prey for a better bite.

In the wolf form, the werewolf can be harmed only by silver or
magical weapons of +1 or better. Wounds from other weapons
heal too quickly to actually injure the werewolf.

Werewolves attack in packs; packs including females and
young drive the adults to hit harder. If the female is attacked, the
male fights at +2 to hit and does full damage with each blow. If
the young are attacked, the female attacks at +3 to hit and does
full damage. Cubs with 60% full growth are -4 to hit, cubs with
70% are -3 to hit, andso on, All cubs inflict 2-5 points of damage.

Habitat/Society: Werewolf packs roam the wilderness in search
of human or other prey. True werewolves tend to be nomadic, al-
though infected werewolves often continue to live the life to
which they were accustomed. Werewolves retreat to their dens
during the winter months or the years when the females are rais-
ing the helpless cubs. As humans, werewolves do not build
homes, although they may take over existing dwellings, some-
times the home of past victims. Caves and burrows are the dens
most commonly used in the wild. These sparsely furnished re-

 

treats are used mostly as a sleeping area and a place to store their
human possessions. Many werewolf families roam the country-
side in wagons, much like gypsies. In fact, this has caused many
gypsies to be accused of being werewolves.

Werewolves live in packs, generally related by bloodlines.
Werewolf packs of five to eight individuals are single family
groups consisting of a male, female, and three to six cubs, six to
nine years old. Cubs under six years old are kept in secluded dens
and never encountered by hostile humans.

When pregnant, the female retreats with her mate and an older
female who will act as midwife. In a very secluded area they pre-
pare a special den that will be home for the mother and her cubs
for the next six years. The female gives birth to a litter of 5-10
cubs. The cubs are born in the hybrid form; they resemble fuzzy
human babies with wolflike faces. Infant mortality is high; 2-4
cubs of each litter never reach 60% growth. Cubs grow at the
same rate as humans for their first five years. By the sixth year
they attain 60% of their full growth. At this point they develop
the ability to transform into their other forms. Each following
year brings an increase of an additional 10% growth. Were-
wolves are considered mature at age 10.

If a werewolf mates with a woman, the offspring is completely
human. The temperament reflects the father; such children are vi-
olent, combative, and prone to mental illness. There is a 10%
chance each year from the onset of adolescence that such a child
will spontaneously transform into a true werewolf.

Ecology: Werewolves are a peculiar hybrid of human and lu-
pine personalities. They are savage killers, yet they are devoted
to their close-knit families. Werewolves are hostile toward lycan-
thropes who oppose them, especially werebears.

SPECIAL ATTACKS: Tail spikes

XP VALUE: 1,400

The manticore is a true monster, with a leonine torso and legs,
batlike wings, a man’s head, a tail tipped with iron spikes, and an
appetite for human flesh.

The manticore stands 6 feet tall at the shoulder and measures 15
feet in length. It has a 25-foot wingspan. Each section of the man-
ticore closely resembles the creature it imitates. The leonine torso
has a tawny hide, the mane is a lion's brown-black color, and the
batlike wings are a dark brown with sparse hair. All manticores
have heads that resemble human males; the mane resembles a
heavy beard and long hair.

Combat: The manticore first fires a volley of 1-6 tail spikes (180
yard range as a light crossbow). Each spike causes 1-6 points of
damage. The manticore can fire four such volleys each day (the
spikes regrow quickly). Next, the manticore closes with its prey
and attacks with its front claws and sharp teeth. In an outdoor
setting, the manticore tries to stay in the air to minimize its chance
of being attacked. It is a clumsy flier, however, and cannot use its
teeth in the air.

Habitat/Society: Manticores are found in any climate but prefer
warm lands to cool ones. This reflects the wide climate range of
their favorite food, humans. A manticore’s territory may cover
20 or more square miles and includes at least one human settle-
ment. Such territories usually overlap with those of other manti-
cores and other man-eating predators like dragons.

Manticores mate for life. The male remains with the female
during gestation and hunts for her. Manticores bear one or two
cubs which grow rapidly to adulthood in five years. Cubs are
born with one hit die and gain an additional one each year. In
their first year, cubs lack flying ability, but they are still small
enough for an adult to grasp in its forelegs. There is a 20% chance
a she-manticore's lair holds cubs under one year old. Cubs up to
two years inflict one point of damage per front paw and 1-2
points with their bite. Cubs 3-4 years old inflict 1-2, 1-2, and 1-6
points of damage.

Manticore cubs can be caught and trained to assist evil hu-
mans. Such training is difficult and dangerous, especially since
domesticated adults have an 80% chance of reverting to a wild
state. Manticores will not allow themselves to be used as mounts.
Wild adults may voluntarily ally themselves with evil humans,
provided such allies can provide them with a steady, ample food

supply.

 

 

 

 

 

Manticores normally eat their prey where they kill it. Males
sometimes haul slain prey back to their mates or drag still-living
prey to their lairs for the cubs to practice killing.

Manticores collect their victims’ valuables for a variety of rea-
sons, including curiosity, emulation of other monsters who col-
lect treasure, the man-scent on the things, or because they know
humans value the things and therefore might come looking for
them. Their lack of real hands prevents most manticores from us-
ing what magical items fall into their possession. However, man-
ticores that have allied with evil humans may possess magical
items designed specifically for their use. Examples include magi-
cal collars or bracelets that are, in effect, oversized magical rings.

Ecology: Manticores are wide-ranging carnivores that have
successfully survived in every region inhabited by humans,
whether in the wilderness or underground. They are nightmarish
opponents but invaluable allies if conditions are right. A manti-
core’s pelt is a mark of the most powerful hunters and warriors.
An intact, cured manticore hide complete with wings is worth
10,000 gp.

Medusae are female humanoids with hair of swarming snakes.
They are hateful creatures who can petrify any creature that
meets their gaze.

The typical medusa has a pale-skinned, very shapely woman's
form. It stands 5 to 6 feet tall with the snakes adding up to another
foot. At distances farther than 30 feet, the medusa is easily con-
fused with a normal woman. Its red-glowing eyes are visible up to
30 feet. At distances of 20 feet or closer, the medusa’s true nature
is revealed. Its face is horrible—the snakes writhe constantly, es-
pecially if the medusa is excited.

Medusae wear human clothing such as loose dresses or robes.
They seldom wear armor and cannot easily wear helmets. Medu-
sae may carry a knife, dagger, or short bow. Medusae speak their
own tongue and the common one.

stone. If an opponent averts his eyes,
the medusa rushes up so that its ser-
pentine growths can attack. The
range of such attacks is only one
foot, but the victim must save versus
poison or die.

The medusa is able to see creatures
in the Ethereal and Astral planes,
and its petrifying gaze is equally as
effective against creatures there. It
retains its petrifying gaze after
death. Creatures looking at a
freshly-dead medusa’s head make a
saving throw at +1. The saving
throw increases +1 each day the
head decays.

If the medusa cannot easily use its normal tactics, it may re-
sort to normal weapons such as knives and shortbows.

Habitat/Society: Medusae dwell in dark caves or the lower re-
gions of large abandoned buildings. They arrange the lighting
such that their homes are filled with flickering shadows.

The presence of petrified victims is a sure indicator of the occu-
pant's true nature. For this, aesthetic, and other reasons, the me-
dusa usually removes most of its victims. Those that resemble
interesting statues may be retained; the rest are often broken into
unrecognizable (and unrevivable) chunks.

The one form of treasure never found in a medusa’s lair is a mir-
ror. If a medusa sees its own reflection in a mirror, it turns to stone
itself. Reflection in nonmetallic reflectors such as water or pol-
ished stone have no such effect. Medusae are immune to the petri-
fying effect of another medusa.

Medusae are infrequently driven to mate with humanoid
males. The act always ends in the male's death, usually by petrifi-
cation when the medusa reveals its previously hidden visage. Two
to six eggs are laid one month later and hatch eight months after
that. The female hatchlings appear as baby girls with stubby
green tendrils. The hatchlings are revolting to look at but cannot
petrify. Medusae grow at the same rate as humans. At about age
two the serpentine hair becomes alive and gains its poisonous
bite. The medusa can petrify with the onset of adolescence.

Greater Medusa (Serpentine)

Rare medusae (10% ) have serpentine bodies in place of the lower
torso and legs. The entire body is covered with fine scales and
measures 10 to 20 feet. The poison of these medusae is so deadly
that saving throws are made at -1, and they are known to use
bows and poisoned arrows. Their blood is so poisonous, in fact,
that even after one has been killed, touching its body still requires
a saving throw versus poison. They seldom venture far from their
lairs, since they are immediately recognizable. Greater medusae
have a morale bonus of +1.

Aborigines/Cavemen Adventurers

These are primitive humans found in otherwise uninhabited re-
gions. For every 10 aborigines there will be a 3rd level fighter. Ab-
original tribes are always led by a chief (a Sth level fighter) and
1-4 subchiefs (4th level fighters). For every 10 aborigines encoun-
tered there is a 10% chance that they have a shaman (3rd level
priest) with them.

Most encounters (60%) will be with predominantly male war
or hunting/gathering parties. There is a 40% chance that the
encounter will be in or near their lair. Aborigines make their lair
in natural shelters such as caves or forest groves. The number en-
countered above is males; there are an equal number of females
and children in the lair.

Aborigines are typically armed with stone axes, spears, and
clubs.

These are NPC counterparts of the PC’s band, groups of fighters,
thieves, priests, and wizards who band together in search of
fame, fortune, and power. Typical adventuring bands consist of
1-8 members. Solitary adventurers may be separated from their
group, lost, advanced scouts, or sole survivors of decimated
groups.

After determining the base size of the group encountered, de-
termine which class each belongs to.

table below.

Level Range

Low 1-3 (d3)
Medium 4-7 (d4+3)
High 7-12 (do +6)
Very high 9-20 (d12 +8)

If an adventurer is ranked high enough to have attracted fol-
lowers, 1-100% of such followers will accompany him. This can
further swell the encountered band’s size into a small army.

Priests and wizards will have 1-100% of their full spells at the
time the encounter occurs (round down).

All higher level fighters will usually be mounted on unbarded
medium warhorses and have plate mail and shields. The same is
true for priests. For each level that an adventurer has attained
there is a 5% chance that he will have the magical accouterments
shown below. Roll for each “Y” item. Reroll if a cursed or other-
wise undesirable item is indicated, but only one reroll is allowed.

In addition, such adventurers have ordinary treasure. Fighters
have types Land M; priests J, K, and M; wizards L, N, and Q; and
rogues J, N, and Q.

Bandits/Brigands
Bandits are rural thieves who openly prey on travelers and iso-
lated dwellings. They travel in groups of 20-200, usually led by
high-level fighters, rogues, wizards, and priests. For every 20
bandits encountered, there will be an additional 3rd level fighter.
Bandits are typically armed with swords, spears, and small
shields. Bandits may wear no armor (50%), leather (35%), pad-
ded (10%), or ring mail (5%).

Barbarians/Nomads

Barbarians belong to primitive cultures that possess rudimentary
skills such as animal husbandry and simple manufacturing
(weaving, carving). They may keep villages of simple buildings
or live entirely in portable structures like tents, teepees, yurts, or
wagons. In aquatic regions, they may live on watercraft like ca-
noes or rafts.

Barbarians are typically armed with swords, knives, bows,
spears, and clubs. Armor is limited to shields, helmets, and
chestplates. They tend to be hostile toward unfamiliar wizards.
Barbarians are adept at surprising opponents; other groups have
a-5 penalty on their surprise rolls.

Berserkers/Dervishes

Berserkers are violent war parties prone to manic behavior in bat-
tle. When encountered, berserkers drive themselves into a battle
frenzy that raises their fighting skills and morale. Berserkers at-
tack twice per round, or once at +2. Many use leather armor and

 

 

 

 

 

shield, giving them Armor Class 7. Berserkers need never make
morale checks.

Dervishes are highly religious nomads. Due to their fanatical
nature, dervishes add 1 to their attack rolls and damage dice.
They never check morale in combat.

If encountered during a peaceful period, berserkers may be in-
distinguishable from normal warrior bands; dervishes may be
mistaken for armed pilgrims.

Farmers/Herders

These are simple people involved in the production of agricul-
tural goods. About 65% of encounters are with farmers tilling
their land. Encounters with herders may be anywhere there is
grazing land or a market to drive the herd to. Encounters with
herders also involve the herd animals, whatever they are.

Gentry

These are the upper classes. They are not the ruling nobility, but
their wealth and connections make them nearly as powerful. Each
member of the gentry encountered may be accompanied by 0-3
guards (d4-1) and 1-6 servants. The guards are mercenary fighters
of 1st to 6th level and armed with sword and spear. The servants
might fight as 0 level fighters, but are more likely to panic. The
gentry themselves can be armed with daggers and shortswords.

Knights

Knights are armored, mounted fighters directly serving their
lord. They may be on a quest, a specific mission, or simply pa-
trolling their lord’s realm. Knights may be accompanied by their
squires, hirelings, and other followers (50%). Knights are armed
with sword, lance, mace or flail, and dagger. Armor includes a
shield and either plate or chain mail. They ride a medium or
heavy warhorse, usually in barding.

About 5% of encounters will be with a vanquished knight. Be-
cause he is stripped of his arms and armor, he may be mistaken
for any nonwarrior class. He may even support this deception, at
least until he can gain weapons.

See “Adventurers” to determine level and special possessions.

Mercenary Soldiers
These are groups of low-level fighters who hire themselves to the

 
Men

 

highest bidder. When encountered there is an even chance they
may be already hired and on their way to a war, rendezvousing a
prospective employer, open for employment, or on their way
home and not willing to be hired again yet.

See “Adventurers” to determine level and special possessions.

Merchant Sailors/Fishermen

These are found on or near open waters. If encountered inland,
sailors may be ferrymen on a stream or river. Fishermen will ei-
ther be on their way toa fishing site, engaged in fishing, or return-
ing with their catch. Sailors may be armed with knives,
shortswords, cutlasses, or belaying pins (1 point of damage).

Merchants/Traders
Merchants and traders deal in goods and services. Those encoun-
tered in the wild are traveling in caravans in search of new busi-
ness elsewhere. Only 10% of the number encountered are
actually merchants: 10% are drovers and the rest are mercenary
guards. The guards are led by a fighter (6th-11th level) and a lieu-
tenant one level lower. Each leader is accompanied by 12 guards
of 2nd level. For each 50 people in the caravan there is a 10%
chance of a wizard (6th-8th level) and a 5% chance of a priest
(Sth-7th level), as well as a 15% chance of a rogue (8th-10th level)
accompanied by 1-4 rogues (3rd-7th level). All such leaders,
guards, and special characters are in addition to the number of
merchants, drovers, and normal guards.

The treasure is mostly in trade goods (90%). The caravan has
10 pack animals or one wagon per 5,000 gp value.

Middle Class

These are travelers journeying on personal business. They are pri-
marily found in civilized regions, although pioneers may be en-
countered in relatively peaceful frontier regions. Middle class
travelers may be armed with knives, daggers, and shortswords.

 

Peasantry (serfs)
Peasants are low class farmers, herders, and simple tradesmen.
Unlike serfs, peasants are freemen.

Serfs are low class subjects of a local lord. They are primarily
involved in agriculture and brute labor in their lord's behalf on

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lands under his direct control. Serfs are little more than slaves.

Both peasants and serfs may be armed with daggers, clubs,
quarterstaffs, and farming tools. They never have any treasure
except under the rarest of occasions when they are able to hoard
scavenged goods.

Pilgrims
Pilgrims are groups of devout individuals on their way to or from
a holy place. They can be found anywhere.

A group of pilgrims will always be accompanied by priests and
other character classes. Such people may be acting as leaders,
guards, or pilgrims. Such groups always include 1-6 2nd level, 1-4
4th level, 1-2 6th level, and one 8th level priest (accompanied by
one 3rd and one Sth level assistant). For every 10 pilgrims, there is
a 10% chance of 1-8 fighters (1st-8th level) and 1-6 rogues (2nd-
7th level). There is a 5% chance per 10 pilgrims of a wizard of 6th-
9th level. If the pilgrims are lawful good, the fighters will be
paladins; if the pilgrims are chaotic good, the fighters will be
rangers. If the party is neutral, the priests will be druidical. If the
pilgrims are lawful evil, they all fight as berserkers, although
armed only with daggers.

Pilgrim alignment is determined below:

d100 Alignment
01-35 Lawful good
36-55 Chaotic good
56-65 Neutral

66-85 Lawful evil
86-00 Chaotic evil

About 75% of pilgrim bands encountered are on foot. There is a
5% chance that a high-level priest will be carrying a religious arti-
fact, carefully hidden and protected by traps and magic.

Pirates/Buccaneers

These are seafaring thieves and fighters (1st-4th level). Bucca-
neers are always led by a captain of 8th or 10th level — 8th if
fewer than 200 buccaneers. The captain will have a 6th or 7th
level lieutenant and four mates of 4th level. For every 50 bucca-
neers encountered, there will be a 3rd level fighter, as well as a
15% chance for a priest of 12th- 15th level and a 10% chance fora

 
Men

 

wizard of 6th-9th level. For every 100 buccaneers, there will be a
5th level fighter. All of these “extra” characters are in addition to
the regular buccaneers indicated on the dice.

Buccaneers wear leather armor; leaders wear chain mail. All
are armed with knives, swords, bows, and polearms. In addition,
their ships may be equipped with ballistae or catapults.

Police/Constabulary
These are the duly appointed representatives of the local govern-

ment, concerned with upholding the laws, maintaining the peace,
and carrying out their superior’s will. If constables are encoun-
tered in the wilderness, they might be pursuing a fugitive (50%)
or investigating a case on the outskirts of their jurisdiction (50%).
Constables are the equivalent of fighters of 1st-4th level. Wilder-
ness encounters include a 25% chance that the police are accom-
panied by a mob. The mob is composed of citizenry temporarily
deputized to assist the police; they fight as 0 level fighters.

Priests
These are typical NPC priests traveling on personal business or

ona mission. The number encountered refers to the number of ac-
tual priests. If they are of high enough level, they might also have
followers accompanying them (50%).

See “Adventurers” to determine level and special possessions.

Sailors
Nonmerchant sailors are the seagoing armed forces of the local

government, acting as police or soldiers. They may be patrolling
their home waters, pursuing a waterborne criminal, or on their
way to or from a mission in other waters. They act as 1st level
fighters. Each ship is commanded by a captain (6th level fighter)
and a first officer (Sth level fighter). Sailors are armed with
swords, knives, bows, and polearms. In addition, each ship may
be armed with heavier weapons such as catapults and ballistae.

Slavers
Slavers are usually found in control of a band of captive slaves; if

no slaves are present, the slavers may be mistaken for merce-
naries or brigands. The slavers’ leader might be a thief, fighter, or
fighter-thief (6th-11th level), assisted by a lieutenant one level
lower. Each leader is accompanied by 1-12 guards of 1st or 2nd
level. For each 50 slaves and slavers, there is a 10% chance of a
wizard (6th-8th level) and a 5% chance of a priest (Sth-7th level);
these work for the slavers.

There are 10 slaves present for each 1-10 slavers. Slaves are
treated the same as serfs. They may be recently acquired captives
being taken from their homelands or long- time slaves being
moved to a new market. Such slaves will be on foot and linked to-
gether in strings of 10-100 by ropes or chains. They will be willing
to help any adventurers who try to rescue them, although they
will be limited in the help they can provide. Slaves may be any
class or type, but only 1% of captives belong to one of the charac-
ter classes.

Soldiers
These are organized militia engaged in the defense of their home

region. Soldiers are led by a captain (6th level or higher) and a
lieutenant 1-4 levels lower. Each leader is accompanied by 1-12
soldiers of 1st or 2nd level. Most soldiers are engaged in routine
patrols of the homeland. If local wars are occurring, there is a
50% chance that the soldiers are either heading off to the war or
returning from it. There is a 5% chance of a cleric (Sth-7th level)
for each 50 soldiers present.

See “Adventurers” to determine level and special possessions.

Thieves/Thugs
These are low level rogues who, if not already engaged in a crime,

 

 

 

 

 

may attempt to rob wealthy or weak-looking adventurers.
Thieves may be armed with concealed weapons such as knives,
darts, blowguns, blackjacks, and shortswords.

See “Adventurers” to determine level and special possessions.

Tradesmen/craftsmen
Tradesmen and craftsmen are engaged in business when encoun-
tered. They may be operating a shop, acquiring materials for
their business, or traveling to or from a client's location. They are
willing to do business with adventurers, provided they are prop-
erly paid. They will not attack except to defend themselves. Note
that 1% of tradesmen may be retired adventurers. Tradesmen
may be armed with knives, quarterstaves, and their tools.
About 90% of their treasure will be in merchandise or their
equipment.

Tribesmen
Tribesmen have primitive cultures; they hunt, fish, and farm near
their simple villages. Tribesmen are found in any climate.

For each 10 tribesmen, there will be an additional 3rd level
fighter. Tribes are led by a chief (a 5th level fighter) and 1-4 sub-
chiefs (4th level fighters). For every 10 encountered, there is a sha-
man (4th level priest) with them, and for each 30 tribesmen
encountered, a 6th level shaman. The tribe has a witchdoctor (8th
level priest). Shamans and witchdoctors tend to be druidical in
nature.

Tribal villages are made of local materials (grass, bamboo,
mud, ice). In addition to the males encountered, there will also be
an equal number of women and a 75% chance of 20-50 slaves.

Tribesmen’s weapons are typically clubs, knives, spears, and
bows. Armor is limited to shields.

Wizards
These are typical NPC wizards. They may be engaged in personal
business, gathering materials, or traveling to or from a business
engagement. The number encountered refers to the number of ac-
tual wizards; they may be accompanied by 0-3 (d4-1) servants
and guards for each wizard. Guards are fighters 1-4 levels lower
than the wizard they protect.

Of all the creatures of the Underdark, the illithid, or mind flayer,
is both the most evil and most inhuman. It is also the most feared,
for its powers are formidable and it feeds on the brain of any hu-
man, demihuman, or humanoid creature it encounters. Using
sheer mental power, it is able to enslave or destroy its foes, which
include such powerful creatures as drow and kuo-toa.

Mind flayers stand about 6 feet tall, with hideous mauve skin
that glistens with slime. The head resembles an octopus, with
white eyes (no pupils are evident) and four tentacles protruding
from where a mouth should be. The creature has three fingers and
a thumb on each hand; its fingers have a reddish cast, though the
rest of the hand is mauve. Mind flayers can communicate with all
creatures via telepathy; they have no spoken language, though
they have been known to accompany their thoughts with faint
hissing and the eager lashing of their tentacles. Mind flayers dress
in flowing robes, adorned with symbols of death and despair.

Combat; A mind flayer can use its four tentacles in combat. If a
tentacle hits, it will reach the opponent's brain in 1-4 rounds, drawing
it forth and killing the victim. The mind flayer then devours the
brain. Even more deadly than this is the mind flayer’s mental blast,
which spreads in a cone 60 feet long, 5 feet wide at the base and 20
feet wide at its end; all within the area of effect must save versus
wands at -4 or be stunned for 3-12 (d10 +2) rounds.

The mind flayer’s mental talents also allow it to use the follow-
ing powers, one per round, asa 7th level mage: suggestion, charm
monster/person, ESP, levitate, astral projection, and plane shift.
Mind flayers have infravision. All saving throws against a mind
flayer’s mental powers are at -4, due to its powerful mental force.
If an encounter is going against a mind flayer, it will immediately
flee, seeking to save itself regardless of its treasure or its fellows.

In mass combat, the mind flayer tries to take as many prisoners
as possible. These prisoners will become slaves, and a source of
food in times of shortage.

Habitat/Society: Mind flayers live in large underground com-
munities of 200 to 2,000 illithids, plus at least two slaves per il-
lithid. The minds of the slaves are stripped of any capacity for
independent thought (by use of the charm ability) so they obey
their illithid masters without question. Mind flayers hate sunlight
and will avoid it whenever possible.

The center of each community is the elder-brain, a pool of
briny brain fluid that contains the brains of the community's dead

 

 

 

 

 

mind flayers. Due to the powerful mental force of illithids, the
elder-brain remains sentient even after their bodies have been de-
stroyed, and the telepathic union of these brains of the dead rules
the community. The elder-brain has a telepathic range of two to
five miles (depending on the size and age of the community). The
elder-brain cannot attack, but it can telepathically warn the mind
flayers of the presence of thinking creatures, so a mind flayer
within its telepathic radius cannot be surprised, except by nonin-
telligent creatures. The telepathic range of the elder-brain repre-
sents the territory that a community will claim and defend,
though a community will send raiding parties far beyond this
limit. Mind flayers have no family structure. Their social activi-
ties are limited to eating, communicating with the elder-brain,
and debating on the best tactics to conquer the Underdark. For
amusement, they inflict pain on their captives and force their
slaves to fight each other in gladiatorial games.

Mind flayers are extremely arrogant, viewing all other species
only as cattle to be fed on. They prefer to eat the brains of think-
ing creatures,

Ecology: Mind flayers have a lifespan of about 125 years. They
are warm-blooded amphibians, and spend the first 10 years of life
in a tadpole state, swimming in the pool of the elder-brain until
they either die (which most do) or grow into a fully developed il-
lithid. Illithid are sexless; each flayer is capable of producing off-
spring (twice per lifetime, once every 20 years).

Mind flayer ichor is an effective ingredient in a potion of ESP.

Minotaurs are either cursed humans or the offspring of minotaurs
and humans. They usually dwell in underground labyrinths, for
they are not confused in these places, which gives them an advan-
tage over their prey.

Minotaurs are huge, well over 7 feet tall, and quite broad and
muscular. They have the head of a bull but the body of a human
male. Their fur is brown to black while their body coloring varies
as would a normal human's. Clothing is minimal, usually a loin
cloth or skirt.

Combat: Minotaurs are very strong (equivalent human
Strength of 18). Against man-sized opponents (minimum 6 feet
tall) they may butt for 2-8 points of damage. Against smaller op-
ponents, they bite for 1-4 points of damage. If a minotaur is 30
feet or more from its opponent, it can lower its head and charge
against any creature that is at least 6 feet tall. If successful, the
charge causes double head-butt damage. In addition to these at-
tacks, most minotaurs also carry weapons—a huge ax (treat as a
halberd) or flail, with which it inflicts normal damage +2.

Minotaurs are not particularly intelligent, but are extremely
cunning and have excellent senses. They have a +2 bonus on
their surprise rolls, have infravision, and can track prey by scent
like a ranger, with 50% accuracy. They always pursue an unfa-
miliar scent. Minotaurs are immune to maze spells. They attack
any intruder without fear, and will retreat only if the creature is
obviously beyond their ability to defeat (+3 to morale score in
combat).

Habitat/Society: Minotaurs live in communities of up to eight
members. If the community contains more than six minotaurs,
one will be an elder minotaur with 18/50 Strength and 8 +4 Hit
Dice. The minotaur elder is the clan leader; he remains in the cen-
ter of the labyrinth and raises young minotaurs while others
hunt. He is always encountered in the center of a labyrinth.

A minotaur’s labyrinth is rarely natural. Often an evil wizard
ora tyrant will construct a labyrinth and place the minotaur fam-
ily there, feeding it prisoners and slaves on a regular basis.

Occasionally this tyrant will be killed and the minotaurs forced
to fend for themselves; since creatures rarely enter a labyrinth on
their own accord, these minotaurs will usually be ravenously

hungry.

 

 

 

 

 

Minotaurs speak their own primitive language and are 25%
likely to speak a halting form of common. They have little cul-
ture; their lives resemble animals more than humans. Their cul-
ture venerates physical strength above all else and particularly
strong human fighters have been known to earn their respect.
They worship crude gods and have weak clerics (maximum 3rd
level shaman). Rumors persist of more intelligent minotaurs with
developed societies.

Ecology: The curse which creates minotaurs is unknown, but
sages suspect it involves “crimes against the natural order.” Mino-
taurs are always male. It is also said that the first minotaur was
originally a great and ill-tempered human fighter; he wanted to
be as strong as a bull and his wish was granted in the most hideous
manner possible. Minotaurs breed with human females to pro-
duce offspring, which are male minotaurs. Minotaurs have a life-
span of 200 years. They can live without food for years at a time,
but are always hungry unless they are fed regularly. They are
meat-eaters, but their curse causes them to prefer a diet of human
flesh, Those transformed into minotaurs by curses may be re-
stored to human form by a wish, but those who were born as
minotaurs cannot be made human. Gnolls are their natural ene-
mies; they will kill each other on sight.

Minotaur components are sometimes used in spells and po-
tions, and might be used in magical items involving strength, lo-
cation, and misdirection.

MAGIC RESISTANCE: Nil

SIZE: S (4’ high)
MORALE: Special
XP VALUE: 175

Mud-men are formed in pools of mud where enchanted rivers
(even mildly enchanted ones, such as a stream eroding a magical
structure) collect and evaporate and concentrate the dweomer.
Because they are creatures of magic, mud-men are sometimes
called dweomerlings. Mud-men are unintelligent life forces with
but one goal—to protect their pools against intruders.

When aroused into a physical form, mud-men take on the ap-
pearance of animated mud in a stocky humanoid shape, about 4
feet tall. Their coloration varies between a dirty brown and tar
black. They have four thick fingers on each hand. Their legs stay
submerged within the pool, and are not usually visible. Their
eyes are pools of jet black shadow.

Mud-men speak no languages and are incapable of communi-
cating with any living creature.

Combat: In their dormant state, mud-men wait beneath the sur-
face of the pool, spread on the bottom, feeding on the dweomer.
In this state they are immune to all weapons, even magical ones.
Spells that normally harm a mud-man will still affect it, although
damage is divided evenly among all the mud-men in the pool (the
entire group counts as one creature for these effects, and fractions
are rounded down). When a creature enters the pool the mud-
men immediately sense its presence and take but a single round to
draw their substance together and rise to the surface, ready to at-
tack on the following round. Once fully formed and standing, a
mud-man can be harmed by magical weapons.

Mud-men attack by hurling mud at their opponents, who are
considered AC 10 (modified by Dexterity) for the purpose of de-
termining hits. Mud hardens on impact and slows the creature's
movement rate by 1 if it hits. While hurling mud, a mud-man will
also advance on its victim at its full movement rate. Once within
10 feet, it will hurl itself (literally) at the victim. A sucessful hit
means the death of the mud-man, but slows the victim’s move-
ment by 4. A miss means the mud-man must spend the next round
re-forming in order to attack again.

Once a victim's movement is brought to 0, he becomes immobi-
lized and suffocates, suffering 1-8 points of damage per round un-
til the mouth or nose is clear. The victim will die of suffocation in
five consecutive rounds unless rescued. Hardened mud can be
cleared from a character's nose and mouth in one round. Move-
ment can be restored at a rate of 1 per five rounds.

If the creature flees the pool, the mud-men will not pursue, as
their senses do not extend beyond the pool. Instead, they sink

 

 

 

 

 

into the depths, return to their dormant state, and wait until the
next time someone enters the pool.

Mud-men are affected by all spells that cause damage to living
creatures (e.g., cause light wounds, magic missile, fireball, flame
strike). Dispel magic and dig act as fireballs cast at the same level
as the mage.

Transmute mud to rock kills all mud-men within its area of ef-
fect, with no saving throw allowed.

Mud-men are immune to all poisons, natural and magical, and
are unaffected by spells that affect the mind (e.g., hold, charm,
and sleep).

Habitat/Society: Mud-men have two states: rest and activity,
the latter of which solely involves killing intruders. A mud-man’s
pool varies in size between 20 and 200 feet in diameter. Such pools
are often found near waterfalls.

Ecology: Mud-men are not natural creatures and not part of the
ecosystem. They try to kill all natural creatures that encounter
them and have no natural enemies. Over a long period of time
they absorb flesh, wood, and bone, extracting whatever
dweomer they can get from it, so they rarely possess any
treasure—only if they were attacked within the last month by
someone who was bearing treasure. Though no uses have been
recorded for a mud-man’s mud, it is logical that mages would not
ignore its magical properties.

Mummies are corpses native to dry desert areas, where the dead
are entombed by a process known as mummification. When their
tombs are disturbed, the corpses become animated into a weird
unlife state, whose unholy hatred of life causes them to attack liv-
ing things without mercy.

Mummies are usually (but not always) clothed in rotting strips
of linen. They stand between 5 and 7 feet tall and are supernatu-
rally strong.

Combat: Mummies are horrific enemies. A single blow from
one’s arm inflicts 1-12 points of damage, and worse, its scabrous
touch infects the victim with a rotting disease which is fatal in 1-6
months. For each month the rot progresses, the victim perma-
nently loses 2 points of Charisma. The disease can be cured only
with a cure disease spell. Cure wounds spells have no effect on a
person inflicted with mummy rot and his wounds heal at 10% of
the normal rate. A regenerate spell will restore damage but will
not otherwise affect the course of the disease.

The mere sight of a mummy causes such terror in any creature
that a saving throw versus spell must be made or the victim be-
comes paralyzed with fright for 1 to 4 rounds. Numbers will bol-
ster courage; for each six creatures present, the saving throw is
improved by +1. Humans save against mummies at an addi-
tional +2.

Mummies can be harmed only by magical weapons, which in-
flict only half damage (all fractions round down). Sleep, charm,
hold, and cold-based spells have no effect. Poison and paralysis
do not harm them. A resurrection spell will turn the creature into
anormal human (a fighter at 7th level ability) with the memories
of its former life; or will have no effect if the mummy is older than
the maximum age the priest can resurrect. A wish will also restore
a mummy to human form but a remove curse will not.

Mummies are vulnerable to fire, even nonmagical varieties. A
blow with a torch inflicts 1-3 points of damage. A flask of burning
oil inflicts 1-8 points of damage on the first round it hits and 2-16
on the second round. Magical fires are +1 damage/die. Vials of
holy water inflict 2-8 points of damage per direct hit.

Any creature killed by a mummy rots immediately and cannot
be raised from death unless both a cure disease and a raise dead
spell are cast within six rounds.

Habitat/Society: Mummies are the product of an embalming
process used on wealthy and important personages. Most mum-

 

 

 

 

mies are corpses without magical properties. On occasion, per-
haps due to powerful evil magic or perhaps because the
individual was so greedy in life that he refuses to give up his trea-
sure, the spirit of the mummified person will not die, but taps into
energy from the Positive Material plane and is transformed into
an undead horror. Most mummies remain dormant until their
treasure is taken, but then they become aroused and kill without
mercy.

A mummy lives in its ancient burial chamber, usually in the
heart of a crypt or pyramid. The tomb is a complex series of
chambers filled with relics (mostly nonmagical). These relics in-
clude models of the mummy's possessions, favorite items and
treasures, the bodies of dead pets, and foodstuffs to feed the spirit
after death. Particularly evil people will have slaves or family
members slain when they die so the slaves can be buried with
them. Because of their magical properties, mummies exist on both
Prime and Positive Material planes.

Ecology: To create a mummy, a corpse should be soaked in a
preserving solution (typically carbonate of soda) for several
weeks and covered with spices and resins. Body organs, such as
the heart, brain, and liver, are typically removed and sealed in
jars. Sometimes gems are wrapped in the cloth (if the treasure list-
ing for the mummy indicates it possesses gems, a few may be
placed in the wrappings). Mummies are not part of the natural
ecosystem and have no natural enemies.

Mummy dust is a component for rotting and disease magic
items.

Nixies are water sprites that live in fresh water lakes, and while
they carry no grudge against humankind, they delight in enslav-
ing men as their beasts of burden.

With webbed fingers and toes, pointed ears, and wide silver
eyes, nixies bear little resemblance to their woodland cousins.
Most are slim and comely, and they have lightly scaled, pale
green skin and dark green hair. Females are attractive, often twin-
ing shells and pearl strings in their thick hair, and they modestly
dress in tight-fitting wraps woven from colorful seaweeds. The
males wear loin cloths of the same materials. Nixies are naturally
able to breathe water and they also retain the ability to breathe
air, so travel on land is possible, although they prefer not to leave
their lakes except in dire circumstances. Nixies speak their own
language and the common tongue.

Combat: If one or more men approach within 30 feet of a group
of nixies, the creatures will pool their magic to create a powerful
charm spell, one such spell for every 10 nixies, which requires the
victim to save versus spell at -2 on the die roll. Once a person is
charmed but before he enters the water there is a 75% chance that
a dispel magic spell will break the charm. Once in the water the
chance of dispelling the magic drops to 10%. Nixies keep their
charmed slaves for one full year, forcing them to do all their
heavy labor, but thereafter the charm wears off and the victim is
set free. During this enslavement, the nixies will keep a water
breathing spell on the human captive, for nixies can cast this spell
on any creature, or dispel it, once per day (duration is one day).

Male nixies carry long daggers and darts (javelins) which are
used as spears under water and missiles above. Usually, each nixie
has one of each weapon. The javelins can be cast a maximum of
60 yards (10 yards short range, 30 yards medium). Occasionally,
nixies employ their fishing nets in battle, but it takes 10 nixies to
wield the large nets and their prey must be in the water with them
(roll to hit AC10 to ensnare a single man-sized creature, +2 to the
AC for each additional victim, up to five total). Sometimes nixies
will employ their guardian fish or pets in battle (see below).

Even with their 25% magic resistance, nixies fear fire and very
bright lights, so a flaming sword or a light spell will keep them at
bay. Nixies will try to negate a continual light spell by summon-
ing small fish to crowd around the light and dim it.

Habitat/Society: Nixie dwellings are woven from living sea-
weed and it is only 5% likely that their lair will be noticed at any

 

 

 

 

 

distance under 20 feet (it is impossible to detect from farther away
than 20 feet). Nixies keep giant fish as guards, either 1-2 gar
(20%) or 2-5 pike (80%), and these are taught to obey simple
commands. Small ornamental shiners or rainbow-hued fish are
kept as pets and trained to perform elaborate tricks. Trout, bass,
and catfish are herded as food. Nixies can also summon 10-100
small fish (this takes 1-3 rounds).

Nixie tribes number from 20 to 80 individuals, with one third of
the population being youths. Individual families number from
four to eight members, and the tribe usually includes 10-15 dis-
tinct families, each related to the other through a common ances-
tor. These nixie tribes control an area with a radius of three to five
miles, and when a tribe gets too large, two or three families split
off to form a new tribe.

Nixie tribes are ruled by the Acquar (water mother) who is a di-
rect descendant of the original founding ancestor. This is a heredi-
tary position. She decides major disputes and chooses the most
apt warrior to be the S’oquar, the warlord of the tribe responsible
for the hunt and defense. The Acquar is advised by a council of el-
ders, whose spokesperson is called the Luquar, the keeper of the
tribe's oral history. Treasures, whether the spoils of war or the re-
sults of work or luck, are divided equally by the Acquar. Intertri-
bal rivalries are often fierce and females are sometimes kidnapped
as brides, for nixies are polygamists, keeping two to three wives.
Birth rates in the tribes are high but many children are lost in their
first years, so the overall population grows slowly. Nixies wor-
ship water and nature powers.

Ecology: Lakes with nixie tribes are kept clean and well
stocked, and often the human slaves are worked to improve the
environment through the removal of trash and obstructions.
Nixie artifacts include jewelry of shells, pearls and opals, silk
from waterspiders, and potions of water breathing.

| So beautiful that a glimpse can blind or even kill a man, the
nymphs are the embodiment of loveliness, a triumph of nature.

A nymph’s beauty is beyond words—an ever-young woman
_ with sleek figure and long, thick hair, radiant skin and perfect
teeth, full lips and gentle eyes. A nymph’s scent is delightful, and
her long robe glows, hemmed with golden threads and embroi-
dered with rainbow hues of unearthly magnificence. A nymph’s
demeanor is graceful and charming, her mind quick and witty.
_ Nymphs speak their own musical language and the common
tongue.

Combat; Neutral in their alliances and cares, nymphs do not
fight, but flee if confronted by an intruder or danger. Nymphs are
able to cast dimension door once per day, and can employ druidi-
cal priest spells at 7th ability level, giving a nymph four Ist, two
2nd, two 3rd, and one 4th level spell once per day. Looking at a
nymph will cause permanent blindness unless the onlookers save
versus spell. If the nymph is nude or disrobes, an onlooker will
die unless a saving throw versus spell is successful.

Habitat/Society: These beautiful females inhabit only the love-
liest of wilderness places, clear lakes and streams, glacier palaces,
ocean grottoes, and crystalline caverns. Nymphs prefer a solitary
existence, but very occasionally a few will gather together in a
place of spectacular charm, though these rendezvous seldom last
for more than a few months. Animals of all types flock to a
nymph to be petted and caressed, forgetting their natural enemies
to gather around the lovely creature.

There is a 10% chance that a nymph will be friendly if ap-
proached by a good creature without the latter first glimpsing the
nymph, by calling or other prior notice. On the other hand, if a
nymph sees a human male with 18 Charisma and good alignment
before he sees her, it is 90% probable that the nymph will be fa-
vorably inclined toward the man. It is still necessary to make sav-
ing throws upon sighting the nymph.

Nymphs hate ugliness and evil and sometimes will help to de-
feat it. Any treasure they possess has usually been given to them
by some lovesick man.

Ecology: Like a druid, a nymph believes in the sanctity of na-
ture and her environment and will try to keep her lair safe and
pure. She will heal wounded animals and mend broken trees and
plants. Sometimes she will even help a human in distress (5%

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chance). Since nymphs live for many generations, they can pro-
vide a wealth of information on the history of an area and often
know secret places, hide-outs, and entrances long forgotten. If a
man is kissed by a nymph, all painful and troubling memories are
forgotten for the rest of the day—this may be a boon to some and
a curse to others. A lock of nymph’s hair can be used to create a
powerful sleeping potion or, if enchanted and woven into a cloth
and sewn into a garment, will magically add one point to the
wearer's Charisma. The tears of anymph can be used as an ingre-
dient in a philter of love. If a woman bathes in a nymph’s pool,
her Charisma is increased by two points until she bathes again.

Ogres are big, ugly, greedy humanoids that live by ambushes,
raids and theft. Ill-tempered and nasty, these monsters are often
found serving as mercenaries in the ranks of orc tribes, evil cler-
ics, or gnolls. They mingle freely with giants and trolls.

Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 300 to 350 pounds.
Their skin colors range from a dead yellow to a dull black-brown,
and rarely a sickly violet. Their warty bumps are often of a differ-
ent color—or at least darker than their hides. Their eyes are pur-
ple with white pupils. Teeth and talons are orange or black. Ogres
have long, greasy hair of blackish-blue to dull dark green. Their
odor is repellent, reminiscent of curdled milk. Dressing in poorly
cured furs and animal hides, they care for their weapons and ar-
mor only reasonably well. It is common for ogres to speak orc,
troll, stone giant, and gnoll, as well as their own guttural lan-
guage. A typical ogre’s life span is 90 years.

Combat: In small numbers, ogres fight as unorganized individ-
uals, but groups of 11 or more will have a leader, and groups of 16
or more usually include two leaders and a chieftain. Ogres wield-
ing weapons get a Strength bonus of +2 to hit; leaders have +3,
chieftains have +4. Females fight as males but score only 2-8
points of damage and have a maximum of only 6 hit points per
die. Young ogres fight as goblins.

Habitat/Society: Ogre tribes are found anywhere, from deep
caverns to mountaintops. Tribes have 16-20 males, 2-12 females,
and 2-8 young. Shamans, if present, will be of 3rd level, and have
access to the spheres of combat, divination, healing, protection,
and sun (darkness only). Ogres live by raiding and scavenging
and they will eat anything. Their fondness for elf, dwarf, and
halfling flesh means that there is only a 10% chance that these will
be found as slaves or prisoners. There is a 30% chance that an
ogre lair will include 2-8 slaves. Captured prisoners are always
kept as slaves (25%) or food (75%). Extremely avaricious, ogres
squabble over treasure and cannot be trusted, even by their own
kind.

Ogre Leader

When more than 11 ogres are encountered, a leader will be
present. He is a 7 Hit Dice monster with 30-33 hit points and Ar-
mor Class 3. He inflicts 5-15 (2d6 +3) points of damage per at-
tack.

Ogre Chieftain

If 16 or more ogres are encountered, they will be led by two patrol
leaders and a chieftain. The chieftain is a 7 Hit Dice monster with
34-37 hit points and Armor Class 4. He inflicts 8-18 (2d6 +6)
points of damage per attack. Chieftains are usually the biggest
and smartest ogres in their tribes.

Ecology: Ogres consistently plague mankind, lusting for gold,
gems, and jewelry as well as human flesh. They are evil-natured
creatures that join with other monsters to prey on the weak and
favor overwhelming odds to a fair fight. Ogres make no crafts
nor labor.
Ogre

 

Ogre Mage

The oriental ogre has light blue, light green, or pale brown skin
with ivory horns. The hair is usually a different color (blue with
green, green with blue) and is darker in shade; the main exception
to this coloration is found in ogre magi with pale brown skin and
yellow hair. They have black nails and dark eyes with white pu-
pils. The teeth and tusks are very white. Ogre magi are taller and
more intelligent than their cousins and they dress in oriental
clothing and armor.

Combat: Ogre magi can perform the following feats of magic:
fly (for 12 turns), become invisible, cause darkness in a 10-foot
radius, polymorph to a human or similar bipedal creature (4 feet
to 12 feet tall), and regenerate one hit point per round (lost mem-
bers must be reattached to regenerate). Once per day they can do
the following: charm person, sleep, assume gaseous form, and
create a cone of cold 60 feet long with a terminal diameter of 20
feet, which inflicts 8-64 (8d8) points of damage (save versus spell
for half damage). Oriental ogres attack with magic first and re-
sort to physical attacks only if necessary. They are +1 on morale.

In battle, ogre magi prefer the naganata (75%) or scimitar and
whip (25%). Those found in oriental settings might (25%) possess
ki power or have mastered a martial arts form. As ogre magi are
intelligent, they will not fight if faced with overwhelming odds,
but will flee to gather their forces or hide.

Habitat/Society: These monsters live in fortified dwellings or
caves and foray to capture slaves, treasure, and food. Ogre magi
priests of up to 7th level have been reported. Tribes are small,
with 2-5 females and 1-3 children which will not fight, but rather
seek escape in gaseous form. These monsters are extremely pro-
tective of their young and will battle with savage abandon to save
one’s life. If a young ogre mage is captured, these creatures will
pay high ransom for its return, but they will seek revenge and will
never forget the insult of the kidnaping.

If encountered in their lair, ogre magi will be led by a chief of
great strength ( +2 on each hit die, attacking and saving as a 9 Hit
Dice monster). Treasure is divided by this chief and his trove is al-
ways the richest. The tribe will have their own clan symbol typi-
cal to the oriental lands, and this symbol will be stitched on its
war banners and flags as well as on armor and headdresses. The
chief will often have the tribe's symbol tattooed on his forehead
or back.

Ogre magi speak the common tongue, their own special lan-
guage, and the speech of normal ogres.

Ecology: Ogre magi magical armor is too large to fit a man. This
monster's lair is usually a powerful structure that can be expanded
into a mighty fortress if it can be rid of its original owners.

Merrow (Aquatic Ogre)

Faster and fiercer than their land kin, the freshwater merrow are
greenish and scaled with webbed hands and feet. Their necks are
long and thick, their shoulders are sloping, and they have huge
mouths and undershot jaws. Merrow have black teeth and nails
and deep green eyes with white centers, and their hair resembles
slimy seaweed. About 10% grow ivory horns, especially the
more powerful males.

Aquatic ogres are very fond of tattoos, and females may have
their entire bodies inked with scenes of death and destruction as a
sign of status. Merrow speak their own dialect and the language
of other ogres.

Combat: Using their green coloration, aquatic ogres can hide,
becoming effectively invisible 10-80% of the time, depending on
terrain. They attack from cover, so others are -5 on their surprise

roll. Merrow typically attack with a large piercing spear (inflict-
ing 2-12 points of damage) in a swimming charge at +1 to hit, fol-
lowed by melee with talons and teeth.

Habitat/Society: A typical merrow tribe consists of:
1 chief, AC3, 6+6 Hit Dice, +2 on damage
2 patrol leaders, AC3, 5+5 Hit Dice, +1 on damage
2-24 standard merrow
2-24 females, ACS, 3+3 Hit Dice, 1-2/1-2/1-6 damage
1-12 young, AC6, 2 +2 Hit Dice, 1-2/1-2/1-4 damage
1 shaman of 3rd level ability

Merrow dwell in caves in shallow, fresh water (50-250 feet deep),
often with scrags (see Troll). They can live out of water for about
two hours, so they often forage on land. Merrow usually control
an area with a radius of 10-15 miles, hunting and foraging
throughout this territory. In times of scarcity, or when the lure of
treasure becomes too great, a war party will attack the coastal vil-
lages of man. Merrow prefer gold and jewels and often overlook
dull magical items in search of glittering prizes. The goals of a
merrow chieftain rule the tribe, and these power-hungry mon-
sters seek to completely control their “kingdoms,” often leading to
attacks on intruding ships.

Ecology: Merrow are ignorant and superstitious and have no
skills but plundering and murder. Areas of the freshwater lakes
and seas where they have influence are avoided by sailors and
fishermen. These monsters are carnivores, preying on all who en-
ter their regions, often emptying the seas of life with their vora-
cious appetites.

The oozes, slimes and jellies of the underworld are hideous,
amorphous creatures that are the bane of all that lives, dissolving
the weapons, armor, and flesh of their victims.

Ochre Jelly

This monster resembles a giant amoeba, seeping through dark-
ened corridors, through cracks and under doors, searching for
flesh or cellulose to devour. Their form allows them to travel on
walls and ceilings and drop on unsuspecting prey.

Combat: The ochre jelly attacks by attempting to envelop its
prey. Its secretions dissolve flesh, inflicting 3-12 (d10 +2) points of
damage per round of exposure. While a lightning bolt will divide
the creature into one or more smaller jellies, each doing one- half
normal damage, fire- and cold-based attacks have normal effects.

Habitat/Society: An asexual creature, the ochre jelly is a soli-
tary beast that is occasionally found with its own divided off-
spring. It lives only to eat and reproduce.

Ecology: Voraciously dissolving all types of carrion and trash,
this monster is sometimes tolerated in inhabited subterranean ar-
eas for its janitorial services, but this activity is difficult to orga-
nize and is usually not appreciated by the inhabitants because of
its danger.

Gray Ooze

A slimy horror that looks like wet stone or a sedimentary rock
formation, the gray ooze is rarely thicker than six or eight inches,
but sometimes grows to a length of 12 feet. It cannot climb walls
or ceilings, so it slides, drips, and oozes along cavern floors.

Combat: The gray ooze strikes like a snake, and can corrode
metal at an alarming rate (chain mail in one round, plate mail in
two, and magical armor in one round per each plus to Armor
Class). Spells have no effect on this monster, nor do fire- or cold-
based attacks. Lightning and blows from weapons cause full dam-
age. Note that weapons striking a gray ooze may corrode and
break.

Habitat/Society: After a large meal, a gray ooze reproduces by
“budding:” growing a small pod that is left behind in a corridor or
cavern. This pod takes two to three days to mature and then the
little gray ooze absorbs its leathery shell and begins slithering
about, searching for a meal. Sometimes more than one of these
monsters are found together, but this is just a random event be-
cause they are not intelligent.

Ecology: The gray ooze is a dungeon scavenger. It is rumored
that metalworkers of extraordinary skill keep very small oozes in
stone jars to etch and score their metal work, but this is a delicate
and dangerous practice.

Crystal Ooze

This creature is a variety of gray ooze which has adapted to living
in water. It is 75% invisible when immersed in its natural element.
Oozes/Slimes/ellies

 

It is translucent, mostly glassy clear, with an occasional milky
white swirl in its substance.

Combat: Crystal ooze strikes like a snake, then attempts to flow
over a victim and exude its paralyzing poison. Unlike its cousin,
the gray ooze, this creature does not corrode metal, but its poi-
sons attack wood, cloth, and flesh. Unless a victim successfully
saves versus poison, he becomes paralyzed and will be consumed
by the crystal ooze in a short time. When prey is reduced to -20 hit
points, it is totally consumed. Crystal ooze cannot be harmed by
acid, cold, heat, or fire attacks, but electricity and magic missiles
inflict full damage. Blows from weapons inflict only 1 point of
damage per hit. A wooden weapon must save versus acid or it
will dissolve and break.

Habitat/Society: Crystal oozes live in any dim or dark body of
water, though they can exist out of water for several hours. They
reproduce by budding, like the gray ooze, but the crystal pods
usually take seven to 10 days to hatch. Crystal oozes will eat their
offspring but occasionally, if the body of water is large enough
and food is not scarce, a few of them might be found living in the
same water.

Ecology: Crystal oozes are scavengers that leave metal and
stone objects in their wake, so incidental treasure can often be
found around and in their lairs.

Gelatinous Cube

So nearly transparent that they are difficult to see, these cubes
travel down dungeon corridors, absorbing carrion and trash
along the way. Their sides glisten, tending to leave a slimy trail,
but gelatinous cubes cannot climb walls or cling to ceilings. Very
large cubes grow tall to garner mosses and the like from ceilings.

Combat: A gelatinous cube attacks by touching its victim with
its anesthetizing slime. A victim who fails to save versus paraly-
zation is paralyzed (anesthetized) for 5-20 (5d4) rounds. The cube
then surrounds its prey and secretes digestive fluids to absorb the
food. All damage is caused by these digestive acids. Because ge-
latinous cubes are difficult to see, others are -3 on their surprise
roll. Electricity, fear, holds, paralyzation, polymorph, and sleep-
based attacks have no effect on this monster, but fire and blows
from weapons have normal effects. If a cube fails its saving throw
against a cold-based attack, the cube will be slowed 50% and in-
flicts only 1-4 points of damage.

Habitat/Society: Possessing no intelligence, gelatinous cubes
live only for eating. They prefer well- traveled dungeons where
there is always food to scavenge. These creatures reproduce by
budding, leaving clear, rubbery cubes in dark corners or on heaps
of trash. Young are not protected and are sometimes reabsorbed
by the parent. Treasure is sometimes swept up by a gelatinous
cube as the creature travels along a cavern floor; any metals,
gems, or jewelry are carried in the monster's body until they can
be ejected as indigestible. Items found inside a cube include trea-
sure types J, K, L, M, N, Q, as well as an occasional potion, dag-
ger, or similar object.

Ecology: The gelatinous cube is sometimes encouraged to stay
in a certain area for its scavenging abilities, and is preferred over
other jellies and oozes since its square shape does not allow it to
slither under doors and into areas in which it is not desired.

Green Slime

A hideous growth, green slime is bright green, sticky, and wet. It
grows in dark subterranean places on walls, ceilings and floors.

Combat: This slime cannot attack but is sensitive to vibrations
and often drops from the ceiling onto a passing victim. Green
slime attaches itself to living flesh and in 1-4 melee rounds turns
the creature into green slime (no resurrection possible). Green
slime eats through one inch of wood in an hour, but can dissolve
metal quickly, going through plate armor in three melee rounds.
The horrid growth can be scraped off quickly, cut away, frozen,
or burned. A cure disease spell kills green slime, but other at-
tacks, including weapons and spells, have no effect.

Habitat/Society: Green slime hates light and feeds on animal,
vegetable, and metallic substances in dark caverns. Since it can-
not move, this slime grows only when food comes to it. Sunlight
dries it out and eventually kills it. Occasional huge slimes or colo-
nies of dozens have been reported.

Ecology: Green slime is an infestation that all creatures avoid; it
is burned out of caverns or mines if found. Once it has infected an
area, it has a tendency to grow back, even after being frozen or
burned away, because dormant spores can germinate years later.

Orcs are a species of aggressive mammalian carnivores that
band together in tribes and survive by hunting and raiding.
Orcs believe that in order to survive they must expand their
territory, and so they are constantly involved in war against
many enemies: humans, elves, dwarves, goblins, and other
orc tribes.

Orcs vary widely in appearance, as they frequently cross-
breed with other species. In general, they resemble primitive
humans with grey-green skin covered with coarse hair. Orcs

tribe to tribe. Orcs have also
learned to speak local common tongues, but are not comfort-
able with them. Some orcs have a limited vocabulary in gob-
lin, hobgoblin, and ogre dialects.

Combat: Orcs are constantly in battle. They use the following

weapons.
sword and flail 5%
sword and spear 10%
axe and spear 10%
axe and polearm 10%
axe and crossbow 10%
axe and bow 10%
sword and battleaxe 5%
spear 10%
axe 10%
polearm 20%

Polearms are typically either halberds, pikes (set to receive
charge), or glaives. Leaders typically possess two weapons. If a
subchief is present, there is a 40% chance the orcs will be fighting
around a standard. The presence of this standard increases attack
rolls and morale by +1 for all orcs within 60 yards. Orcs typi-
cally wear studded leather armor and a shield (AC 6).

Orcs hate direct sunlight and fight at -1 penalty to their attack
rolls in sunlight. Their morale decreases by 1 under these circum-
stances as well. Orcs employ sniping and ambush tactics in the
wild. They do not obey the “rules of war” unless such is in their
best interests; for example, they will shoot at those who attempt
to parlay with them under a white flag unless the orc leader feels it
is advantageous to hear what the enemy has to say. They abuse
human rules of engagement and chivalry to their best advantage.
They have a historic enmity against elves and dwarves; many
tribes will kill these demihumans on sight.

 
Orc

It is often believed that orcs are so bloodthirsty and cruel that
they are ineffective tacticians and that they would rather be vi-
cious than victorious. Like most stereotypes, this is highly mis-
leading; it is true for some orc tribes but not for all. Many orc
tribes have waged wars for decades and have developed a fright-
ening efficiency with battle tactics.

Habitat/Society: For every three orcs encountered, there will be
a leader and three assistants. These orcs will have 8 hit points
each, being the meanest and strongest in the group. If 150 orcs or
more are encountered there will be the following additional fig-
ures with the band: a subchief and 3-18 guards, each with Armor
Class 4, 11 hit points, and +1 damage due to Strength on all at-
tacks. They fight as monsters of 2 Hit Dice (THACO 19). For
every 100 orcs encountered, there will be either a shaman (maxi-
mum Sth level priest) or a witch doctor (maximum 4th level
mage). Shamans and witch doctors gain an extra 1d4 hit points
for each level above 1st and fight as a monster of 1 Hit Die for
every two levels (round fractions up) of spell-casting ability (e.g.,
a Sth level shaman has d8 + 4d4 hit points and fights as a 3 Hit
Dice monster.)

If the orcs are not in their lair, there is a 20% chance they will be
escorting a train of 1-6 carts and 10-60 slave bearers bringing sup-
plies, loot, or ransom and tribute to their orc chief or a stronger
orc tribe. The total value of the goods carried by all of the carts

_ will vary between 10 and 1,000 silver pieces, and each slave

 

bearer will bear goods valued between 5 and 30 silver pieces. If
the orcs are escorting a treasure train, double the number of lead-
ers and assistants and add 10 orcs for each cart in the train; one
subchief with 5-30 guards will always be in charge.

Orc lairs are underground 75% of the time, in a wilderness vil-
lage 25% of the time. Orc communities range from small forts
with 100-400 orcs to mining communities with 500-2,000 orcs to
huge cities (partially underground and partially above ground)
with 2,000 to 20,000 orcs. There will always be additional orcs
when the encounter is in a creature's lair: a chief and 5-30 body-
guards (AC 4, 13-16 hit points, attack as monsters with 3 Hit Dice
(THACO 17) and inflict an extra +2 damage on all attacks due to
Strength). If the lair is underground, there is a 50% chance that 2-
5 ogres per 200 orcs will be living with them. Most lairs above
ground are rude villages of wooden huts protected by a ditch, log
rampart and log palisade, or more advanced constructions built
by other races. The village will have 1-4 watch towers and a single
gate. There will be one ballista and one catapult for every 100
adult male orcs.

Orcs are aggressive. They believe other species are inferior to
them and that bullying and slavery is part of the natural order.
They will cooperate with other species but are not dependable: as
slaves, they will rebel against all but the most powerful masters;
as allies they are quick to take offense and break agreements.
Ores believe that battle is the ideal challenge, but some leaders are
pragmatic enough to recognize the value of peace, which they ex-
act at a high price. If great patience and care is used, orc tribes can
be effective trading partners and military allies.

Orcs value territory above all else; battle experience, wealth,
and number of offspring are other major sources of pride. Orcs
are patriarchal; women are fit only to bear children and nurse
them. Orcs have a reputation for cruelty that is deserved, but hu-
mans are just as capable of evil as orcs. Orcs have marriage cus-
toms, but orc males are not noted for their faithfulness.

Orcs worship many deities (some who have different names
among different tribes); the chief deity is usually a giant one-eyed
orc. Orcish religion is extremely hateful toward other species and
urges violence and warfare. Orc shamans have been noted for
their ambition, and many tribes have suffered because of political
infighting between warriors and priests.

Ecology: Orcs have an average lifespan of 40 years. They have
a gestation period of 10 months and produce two to three off-
spring per birth. Infant mortality is high. Orcs are carnivores, but
prefer game meats or livestock to demihumans and humanoids.

It is said that orcs have no natural enemies, but they work hard
to make up for this lack. Orc tribes have fearsome names such as
Ne Rune, Bloody Head, Broken Bone, Evil Eye, and Dripping
Blade.

Orcs are skilled miners who can spot new and unusual con-
structions 35% of the time and sloping passages 25% of the time.
They are also excellent weaponsmiths.

Orogs

Elite orcs, or orogs, are a race of great orcs, possibly mixed with
ogre blood. Orogs range between 6 and 61/2 feet tall. They are
highly disciplined warriors and have their own standards and
banners which they display prominently —it is usually easy to tell
when orogs are present among common orcs. Orogs can be found
at the vanguard of large orc armies, but rarely on patrol. There is
a 10% chance that an orc tribe will have orogs, whose number
equals 10% of the male population. (Thus a community of 3,000
male orcs has a 10% chance of having 300 additional orogs.)
Small bands of elites (20-80 orogs) will hire themselves out as
mercenaries. Orogs have 3 Hit Dice, plate mail (AC 3), and have
a +3 Strength bonus on damage dice. For every 20 orogs, there
will also be one leader with 4 Hit Dice (THACO 17). There is but
one orog chief, who has 5 Hit Dice (THACO 15). Orogs use weap-
onry common to orcs, but will typically possess two weapons
apiece.

Half-orcs

Orcs will crossbreed with virtually every humanoid and demihu-
man species except elves, with whom they cannot. The mongrel
offspring of orcs and these other species are known as half-orcs.
Orc-goblins, orc-hobgoblins, and orc-humans are the most com-
mon. Half-orcs tend to favor the orcish strain heavily, and as such
are basically orcs, although 10% of these offspring can pass as
ugly humans. They are treated as humans with levels instead of
Hit Dice. If multi-classed, they have these maximums: priest, 4th
level; fighter, 10th level; thief, 8th level.

If half-orcs remain single-classed, these maximums increase to:
priest, 7th level (Wisdom 15 required for Sth, Wisdom 16 for 6th,
Wisdom 17 for 7th); fighter, 17th level (Strength 18/00 required
for 11th, Strength 19 for 12th, Strength 20 for 14th, and Strength
21 for 17th); thief, 11th level (Dexterity 15 required for 9th, Dex-
terity 16 for 10th, and Dexterity 17 for 11th).

Half-orcs are distrusted by both human and orc cultures be-
cause they remind each of the other's racial stock. Half- orcs ad-
vance in orc culture by flaunting their superior ability and in
human culture by associating with people who don’t care about
appearance. Most tend toward neutrality with slight lawful and
evil tendencies, but lawful good half-orcs are not unknown.
Some half-orcs have split from both cultures to form their own
societies in remote areas. These half-orcs worship their own gods
and (like most hermits) are extremely suspicious of strangers.

Owls are a family of nocturnal birds of prey. There are many different
species and varieties are found in every clime but owls are most common
in temperate and subarctic climates. Owls are predators that hunt ro-
dents, small lizards, and insects, attacking humans only when frightened
(or magically commanded). Some cultures view owls as symbols of wis-
dom; others as symbols of imminent death.

Owls range in size from the pygmy owl, which is 6 inches long, to the
great horned owl which is 2 feet long and has a S-foot wingspread. The
owl statistics listed above are for larger species. Most owls are noted for
their heart-shaped faces and huge eyes (also notable for a nictitating mem-
brane or inner eyelid). Some owls have swept-back ears that look like
horns. Their cries range from gentle hoots to ear-piercing screeches.

Combat: Owls have double normal ultravision, quadruple normal hear-
ing, and fly in total silence, so they will surprise their prey more often;
others are -6 on their surprise roll. Owls cannot be surprised during hours

of dusk and darkness (sunset to sunrise). During daylight hours, their eye-
sight is worse than that of humans, so owls can be surprised more easily;
they are -3 on their surprise roll if discovered in their daylight roosting
place. Owls attack with their sharp talons and hooked beak. If they
swoop from a height of 50 feet or greater, each attack is +2 and inflicts
double damage, but no beak attack is possible.

Habitat/Society: Owls live in virtually every part of the world. Most
owls live in tree hollows, but the burrowing owl lives in holes made by
prairie dogs. Owls try to find the lairs of other birds and drive them away.
Some daylight birds (crows, ravens) that are preyed upon by owls flock to
attack them during the day; because of this, hunters sometimes use owls
as decoys. Owls either live in solitude or in pairs. They can be domesti-
cated somewhat if taken young, but cannot be trained to hunt.

Ecology: Owls prey on rodents, toads, frogs, insects, and daylight
birds. No creatures are known to prey on owls other than monsters such
as wyverns that will attack most flying creatures.

Giant Owl

Giant owls have their own language. They appear as giant versions of
large owl species, with a larger proportionate wingspan. These nocturnal
creatures inhabit very wild areas, preying on rodents, large game birds,
and rabbits. Like ordinary owls, they attack with their talons and beak.
They are too large to gain swoop bonuses but can fly in nearly perfect si-
lence; others are -6 on their surprise roll. Giant owls are intelligent and
may be friendly toward humans, though they are naturally suspicious. If
encountered in their lair, there is a 20% chance there will be 1-3 eggs
(25%) or 1-3 hatchlings (75% ) 20-70% grown. The parents will fight any-
thing that threatens their young. Eggs sell for 1,000 silver pieces and
hatchlings sell for 2,000 silver pieces on the open market.

Talking Ow!

Talking owls are rare and magical creatures indeed. They appear as ordi-
nary owls, but speak common and up to six other languages (DM's op-
tion). Talking owls swoop as do ordinary owls. Their primary role is to
serve and advise champions of good causes on dangerous quests, which
they will willingly do for 1-3 weeks if treated kindly on their first encoun-
ter. (A talking owl sometimes feigns a broken wing to see how the party
treats it.) Talking owls can detect good. Talking owls have a wisdom score
of 21, with appropriate spell immunities (cause fear, charm person, com-
mand, fear, forget, friends, hold person, hypnotism, ray of enfeeblement,
and scare).

Owlbears are probably the crossbred creation of a demented wiz-
ard; given the lethality of this creation, it is quite likely that the
wizard who created them is no longer alive. Owlbears are vi-
cious, ravenous, aggressive, and evil tempered at all times.

Owlbears are a cross between a giant owl and a bear. They are
covered with a thick coat of feathers and fur, brown-black to
yellow-brown in color. The 8-foot-tall males, which weigh be-
tween 1,300 and 1,500 pounds, are darker colored. The beaks of
these creatures are yellow to ivory and their terrifying eyes are
red-rimmed. Owlbears speak their own language, which consists
of very loud screeches of varying length and pitch.

Combat: The owlbear attacks prey on sight, always fighting to
the death (ignore morale rating for purposes of determining re-
treat). It attacks with its claws and snapping beak. If an owlbear
scores a claw hit with a roll of 18 or better, it drags its victim into a
hug, subsequently squeezing its opponent for 2-16 points of dam-
age per round until either the victim or the owlbear is slain. The
owlbear can also use its beak attack on victims caught in its grasp,
but cannot use its claws. A single attempt at a bend bars/lift gates
roll may be made to break from the grasp of an owlbear. Note
that if the Armor Class of a victim is high enough that 18 is insuf-
ficient to hit, the hug is not effective and no damage is taken.

Habitat/Society: Owlbears inhabit the depths of tangled forests
in temperate climes, as well as subterranean labyrinths, living in
caves or hollow stumps.

Owlbears live in mated pairs; the male is slightly larger and
heavier than the female. If encountered in their lair there is a 25%
chance that there will be 1-6 eggs (20%) or young (80%) in addi-
tion to the adults. The offspring will be 40% to 70% grown and
fight as creatures with three or four Hit Dice, depending on their
growth. They have hit points based on their adjusted Hit Dice.
Immature offspring inflict 1-4/1-4/2-8 points of damage with
their attacks and a character has a +20% to his bend bars/lift
gates roll to escape the hug of an immature owlbear.

An owlbear pair claims a territory of one or two square miles
and will vigorously defend this territory against all intruders.

An owlbear's main weakness is also its greatest strength—its fe-
rocity. Because owlbears are so bad-tempered, they stop at noth-
ing to kill a target. It is not difficult to trick an owlbear into
hurling itself off a cliff or into a trap, provided you can find one.

 

   

 

 

 

Ecology: Owlbears have a lifespan of 20 years. They are warm-
blooded mammals, but lay eggs. They prey on anything, from
rabbits to bears to trolls to snakes and reptiles. Owlbears prefer
temperate climates, but some thrive in subarctic environments.
As a hybrid of two animals, one diurnal and the other nocturnal,
they have an unusual active time, waking at noon, hunting ani-
mals active during the day, then hunting nocturnal creatures be-
fore going to sleep at midnight. Owlbears are active in the
summer months and hibernate during the cold season. There are
rumors of white arctic owlbears, a cross between arctic owls and
polar bears, but no specimens have ever been captured.

An owlbear does not actively seek treasure but the remains of
victims may be found buried in shallow holes around an owlbear
lair. Owlbear eggs are worth 2,000 silver pieces and hatchlings are
worth 5,000 silver pieces on the open market. These are typically
bought by wizards; while they are impossible to domesticate,
they make formidable guardians and wizards sometimes place
them in locations of strategic importance (it has been said that an
owlbear is a less subtle version of a “keep out” sign). Owlbears in
dungeons and ruins almost always have been placed there by
someone.

Pegasi are magnificent winged steeds that often serve the cause of
good. These intelligent creatures are very shy and wild, not easily
tamed. They serve only good characters, but if they do, they will
serve their master with absolute faithfulness for the rest of his life.

A pegasus is a thoroughbred which resembles an Arabian horse
(though slightly larger) with two large feathered wings. Pegasi are
usually white, but brown pegasi are not unknown, and rumors per-
sist of black pegasi. As should be expected, alignments do not vary
according to color (all pegasi are chaotic good). Pegasi are 17 hands
tall (five feet at the shoulder) and weigh over 1,500 pounds. Pegasi
must be ridden bareback; they will not accept saddles.

Pegasi speak their own language and can communicate with
horses. They can understand common, and will obey their master's
commands if they are given in that language.

Combat: A pegasus attacks with its hooves and teeth. It can at-
tack an opponent who is behind it with its rear hooves, inflicting
2-12 points of damage, but it cannot use any of its other attacks in
that round. A pegasus can also dive at an opponent from heights
of 50 feet or higher and use its hoof attacks; each attack roll is +2
and does double damage.

In battle, a pegasus will try to lure larger opponents (such as
dragons) into tight spaces. As the opponent struggles to maneu-
ver into attack range, the pegasus climbs and attacks with its
hooves from above. Against creatures their own size, such as grif-
fons, pegasi use their superior speed to outrun them. If griffons
are close to a pegasus nest (especially if there are young present),
one parent will attack aggressively, get the griffon’s attention, and
then fly away. By doing this, they hope to lure enemies away
from the nest and tire them out over a long distance before return-
ing home.

Habitat/Society: Pegasi are egg-laying mammals. If encoun-
tered in their lair, there will be one nest for every pair of pegasi.
There is a 20% chance per nest that there will be 1-2 eggs (30%
chance) or young (70%) of 20-50% maturity. Each egg is worth
3,000 silver pieces, while the young are worth 5,000 silver pieces
per head on the open market.

A pegasus can be used as a warhorse; a male can carry weight
as a medium warhorse (220/330/440), while a female can carry
weight as a light warhorse (170/255/340).

 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Pegasi are intelligent creatures. They can detect good and de-
tect evil at will (60 yard range). They use these powers on those
who would ride them; they try to throw anyone of non-good
alignments who would tame them. If provoked, pegasi will not
hesitate to attack creatures whom they perceive as evil.

To tame a pegasus, a person of good alignment must locate a
pegasus herd. Then, at night, he can try to sneak up on a pegasus
and surprise it. The character must have the airborne riding profi-
ciency. There is an initial +10 penalty to the roll; pegasi do not
like to be tamed. A magical bridle enchanted for the purpose will
remove this penalty. If the character successfully makes his roll,
then the pegasus will be tamed.

A tamed pegasus will obey the commands of its master for as
long as it lives, if the master remains of good alignment.

Ecology: Pegasi feed on grass, fruits, and other plants. Griffons
and hippogriffs are the natural enemies of a pegasus. Pegasi have
a lifespan of about 40 years.

Greater Pegasus

Legend has it that if a medusa is slain and beheaded, there is a
small (5%) chance that a greater pegasus will be born, springing
fully born from the medusa’s cloven neck. These pegasi have the
same attacks and movement rate of a normal pegasus but are
worth 6 Hit Dice and have 20% magic resistance. They also have
a +1 bonus to their morale rating. There is a 5% chance that the
leader of a herd of pegasi will be a greater pegasus. Greater pegasi
can be tamed only by the noblest and greatest of heroes, and have
a lifespan of 100 years.

Piercers resemble stalactites found on cave roofs. They are actu-
ally a species of gastropods that, without their shells, resemble
slugs with long tails. A piercer climbs onto the ceiling of a cavern
and waits patiently; when it detects prey beneath it, it drops from
the ceiling and impales the victim with the sharp end of its shell.

Piercers look like limestone growths on the ceiling of a cavern,
just like ordinary stalactites. They come in the following sizes:
one foot long (1 Hit Die), three feet long (2 Hit Dice), four and
one-half feet long (3 Hit Dice), and six feet long (4 Hit Dice).
Piercers can be identified on very close inspection by a pair of tiny
eyestalks that curl along the side of the stalactite.

Combat: Piercers have only one chance to hit; if an attack fails
to score a kill, the piercer cannot attack again until it slowly scales
a wall to resume its position. Piercers can hear noises and detect
heat sources in a 120-yard radius; these heat sources include hu-
mans. If the noise and light are stationary for many minutes at a
time, piercers will slowly edge into attack position over the
source of the stimulus. Piercers are virtually indistinguishable
from natural phenomena. A group of characters has a -7 modifier
on its surprise roll against a piercer (this guarantees that the group
will be surprised unless it has some positive modifiers).

A piercer, after it has fallen, is slow and fairly easily slain. Its
soft underbelly has one defense mechanism; when exposed to air
it covers itself in a corrosive acid which inflicts 1 point of damage
on contact with flesh. This is usually enough to dissuade natural
predators from disturbing it.

Habitat/Society: While piercers are nonintelligent, the piercers
in a colony are aware of each other. They often fall simultane-
ously, to feed on those killed by other piercers (which makes the
area suddenly very dangerous).

Piercers dwell in caverns, where they live in groups of about 10
members. They prefer to hang over high traffic areas, so they will
usually be found near cave entrances. Aside from mating, the

 

 

 

 

 

 

piercers are not social creatures. There are rumored to be great
caverns deep underground that contain colonies of hundreds of
piercers. Piercers are not attracted to treasure, only to food.

Ecology: The piercer is a mollusk, hatched from a hen-sized egg
which the parent lays in clutches of six to eight in isolated areas of
the cavern. When they hatch, the young appear to be slugs feed-
ing on fungi. After several months, they climb the cavern walls,
secrete a chemical that hardens into the familiar stalactite shape,
and then wait for prey to come.

A piercer has a lifespan of four years and grows one Hit Die per
year. In any group of piercers, the number of creatures with one,
two, three, and four Hit Dice will be nearly evenly divided (e.g.,
in a group of 12 piercers, there will be three one Hit Die piercers,
three with two Hit Dice, three with three Hit Dice, and three with
four Hit Dice).

A piercer can go without food for months. It stores food in a
second stomach that can preserve food for long periods of time;
some alchemists seek out piercers to extract a substance from this
organ and refine it for human use, as it can keep foodstuffs and
precious ingredients fresh for weeks. Piercers also store large sup-
plies of water, extracted from their victims. Piercers can maintain
this water supply for months.

The taste of a piercer is said to resemble that of a snail, but with
a bitter aftertaste. Their eggs and offspring are not traded on the
open market.

Pseudodragons are a species of small flying lizard that inhabits
heavily forested wilderness areas. These playful, benign creatures
have magical powers that they can share with others, so they are
often sought as companions,

Pseudodragons resemble miniature red dragons. They have
fine scales and sharp horns and teeth. A pseudodragon’s colora-
tion is red-brown as opposed to the deep red of red dragons. Its
tail is about 2 feet long (longer than the pseudodragon itself),
barbed, and very flexible.

Pseudodragons communicate via a limited form of telepathy. If
one elects to take a human companion, it can transmit what it sees
and hears at a distance of up to 240 yards. Pseudodragons can vo-
calize animal noises such as a rasping purr (pleasure), a hiss (un-
pleasant surprise), a chirp (desire), or a growl (anger).

Combat: The pseudodragon can deliver a vicious bite with its
small, dragonlike jaws, but its major weapon is its sting-equipped
tail. The creature can move it with flashing speed and strikes at
+4 on attack rolls. Any creature struck must save versus poison
or go into a state of catalepsy that lasts 1-6 days. The victim ap-
pears quite dead, but at the end of that time the character will ei-
ther wake up unharmed (75% chance) or die (25% chance).

Pseudodragons have a chameleonlike power that allows them
to alter their coloration to blend with their surroundings. They
can blend into any typical forest background with an 80% chance
of being undetected by creatures which cannot see invisible ob-
jects. Pseudodragons have infravision with a 60 foot range and
can see invisible objects.

A pseudodragon is highly magic resistant and can transmit this
magic resistance to its human companion via physical contact (a
pseudodragon likes to be perched on the top of one's head or
curled around the shoulders and upper back).

Habitat/Society: These forest-dwelling creatures place their
lairs in the hollows of great trees or in large caves.

A pseudodragon will very rarely take a human or demihuman
as its companion. Some view these pseudodragons as the human's
pet; the pseudodragon will be sure to correct this misunderstand-
ing. There are two ways to become a pseudodragon’s companion;
one is to use magic to summon it (a find familiar spell). Another
way is to find the pseudodragon on an adventure and pursuade it
to become a companion. The pseudodragon that searches for

 

 

 

 

 

 

companionship will stalk a candidate silently for days, reading
his thoughts via telepathy, judging his deeds to be good or evil. If
the candidate is found to be good, the pseudodragon will present
itself to the human as a traveling companion and observe the hu-
man’s reaction. If the human seems overjoyed and promises to
take very good care of it, the pseudodragon will accept. If not, it
will fly away.

The personality of a pseudodragon has been described by some
as catlike. A pseudodragon is willing to serve, provided that it is
well-fed, groomed, and receives lots of attention. At times a
pseudodragon seems arrogant, demanding, and less than willing
to help. In order to gain its full cooperation, the companion must
pamper the pseudodragon and make it feel as though it were the
most important thing in his life. If the pseudodragon is mistreated
or insulted it will leave, or worse, play pranks when least ex-
pected. Pseudodragons particularly dislike cruelty and will not
serve cruel masters.

Ecology: Pseudodragons are omnivorous but prefer to eat
meat. Their diet consists chiefly of rodents and small birds with
occasional leaves, fruits, and berries. In the wild, pseudodragons
live solitary lives, protecting small personal hoards in their nests.
They gather to mate once per year, in early spring, when gather-
ings of dozens of pseudodragons are not uncommon. After mat-
ing, males and females separate; females lay speckled brown eggs
in clutches of four to six which hatch in mid-summer; females
raise the young by themselves. Pseudodragons hibernate in win-
ter; the young leave the nest in spring to mate.

Pseudodragons have a lifespan of 10-15 years. Like dragons,
they are attracted to bright shiny objects. Pseudodragon eggs can
be resold for up to 10,000 gold pieces while a hatchling is worth as
much as 20,000 gold pieces.

Puddings are voracious, puddinglike monsters composed of groups
of cell colonies that scavenge and hunt for food. They typically in-
habit ruins and dungeons. They have the ability to sense heat and an-
alyze material structure from a distance of up to 90 feet to determine if
something is edible. Deadly puddings attack any animal or vegetable
matter (such as humans) on sight.

All deadly puddings are immune to acid, cold, and poison. Lightning
bolts and blows from weapons divide them into smaller puddings, each
able to attack exactly as the original pudding. Fire causes normal dam-
age, as do magic missiles. Puddings can ooze through cracks that are at
least 1 inch wide and can travel on ceilings and walls (falling on victims
as a nasty surprise) at the same speed as on a level surface.

Puddings reproduce by fission. They are adapted to live in a wide
variety of climates.

Puddings starting with 11-30% of maximum possible hit points are
3 feet to 4 feet in diameter; with 31-50% of full hit points, 5 feet wide;

with 51-70% of full hit points, 6 feet wide; with 71-90% of full hit
points, 7 feet wide; and with 91-100% of full hit points, 8 feet wide. If
a pudding is split up so it becomes less than 3 feet wide, it becomes
thinner but retains its 3-foot diameter. Because puddings do not use
all of their mouth openings (which cover their exposed surfaces), the
smallest pudding does the same damage as the largest.

Black Puddings

Black pudding acid is highly corrosive, inflicting 3-24 points of dam-
age per round to organic matter and dissolving a 2-inch thickness of
wood equal to its diameter in one round. Black puddings also dissolve
metal. Chain mail dissolves in one round, plate mail in two; each
magical “plus” increases the time it takes to dissolve the metal by one
round (thus plate mail +3 takes two rounds to dissolve for being plate
mail, plus three rounds for having a +3 magical bonus, for a total of
five rounds).

These cold-loving creatures are 50% likely to be mistaken for ice and
snow (guaranteeing surprise) even under the best of conditions. White
puddings haunt polar regions or icy places in order to find prey, al-
though they can live by devouring any animal or vegetable matter;
even ice provides them with enough nutrition to exist. White puddings
cannot affect metals but dissolve animal and vegetable materials in a
single round, inflicting damage to flesh at an astonishing rate.

Dun Puddings

Adapted to dwell in arid regions, these monsters scavenge barrens
and deserts and feed on silicates (sand) if animal and vegetable matter
is unavailable. They dissolve leather in a single round, regardless of
magical pluses. Metals are eaten at a rate half that of black puddings;
chain takes two rounds to dissolve, plate four rounds, with an addi-
tional two rounds per magical plus.

Brown Puddings

This type dwells principally in marsh areas. It has a tough skin but its
attack is less dangerous than other types of puddings. Brown pud-
dings cannot affect metals but dissolve leather and wood in a single
round, regardless of magical pluses.

Other pudding types are possible, at the DM's option.

Rakshasas are a race of malevolent spirits encased in flesh that
hunt and torment humanity. No one knows where these creatures
originate; some say they are the embodiment of nightmares.

Rakshasas stand 6 to 7 feet tall and weigh between 250 and 300
pounds. They have no uniform appearance but appear as human-
oid creatures with the bodily features of various beasts (most
commonly tigers and apes). Hands whose palms curve backward,
away from the body, seem to be common. Rakshasas of the high-
est standing sometimes have several heads. All rakshasas wear
human clothing of the highest quality.

Combat: Rakshasas savor fresh human meat and use illusions
to get it. They have a limited form of ESP which allows them to
disguise themselves as someone the victim trusts; the rakshasa
uses this illusion as a lure and strikes when the victim is most un-
prepared. The rakshasa must drop the illusion when it attacks.
Normally rakshasas can have magical abilities, up to the follow-
ing limits: four 1st level wizard spells, three 2nd level wizard
spells, two 3rd level wizard spells, and three 1st level priest spells.
These are cast at 7th level ability. Rakshasas are immune to all
spells lower than 8th level. An attacker needs at least a +1 magi-
cal weapon to harm a rakshasa; any weapon below +3 inflicts
only half damage. However, a hit by any blessed crossbow bolt
kills a rakshasa instantly.

Habitat/Society: Rakshasa society is bound by rigid castes.
Each rakshasa is born into a particular role in life and cannot ad-
vance. Females (known as rakshasi) are fit to be consorts, hon-
ored only by their faithfulness and the fighting ability of their
children. There are 1-3 females per male.

Rakshasa society is led by a rajah or maharajah, whose com-
mands are to be obeyed without question.

Rakshasas wage war on humanity constantly, not only to feed
themselves but because they believe that battle is the only way to

     

 

  

 

 

 

gain honor. If confronted by humans who recognize their true ap-
pearance, they are insufferably arrogant.

A rakshasa’s life varies in cycles of wild self-indulgence in times
of prosperity and strict fasting and sacrifice in times of trouble or
before battle. They are honorable creatures but will twist the
wording of an agreement to suit their purposes. They prefer to
deal with humanity by using their illusion powers to deceive and
manipulate them, but are brave and forthright in battle.

Ecology: As spirits, rakshasas are virtually immortal. They
produce a new generation every century to replace the rakshasas
that have been slain in battle. No creatures prey on rakshasas ex-
cept those who would avenge their victims. Rakshasa essence can
be an ingredient in a potion of delusion.

Rakshasa Ruhks

About 15% of all rakshasas are ruhks, or knights. These warriors
are the guardians of a rakshasa community. They are hit only by
magical weapons of +2 or better; any weapon below +4 inflicts
only half damage against them. Their spells are cast at 9th level of
ability.

Rakshasa Rajahs

About 15% of all rakshasa ruhks are rakshasa rajahs, or lords.
Each rajah is the leader (patriarch) of his local clan. These rulers
of rakshasadom have the same abilities as a ruhk, but also have
the spell casting abilities of both a 6th level priest and an 8th level
wizard, cast at 11th level of ability.

Rakshasa Maharajahs

About 5% of all rakshasa rajahs are rakshasa maharajahs, or
dukes. Maharajahs have the same abilities as a ruhk, but have
13 + 39 Hit Dice, and the spell casting abilities of a 13th level wiz-
ard and 9th level priest. A maharajah is the leader of either sev-
eral small, related clans, or a single powerful clan. Maharajahs
reside on the outer planes, where they rule island communities of
hundreds of rakshasas, and serve as minions to even greater
powers.

Rat is the general name applied to a number of species of long-
tailed rodent scavengers between five inches and one foot long.
Rats are aggressive, active, ominivorous, and adaptable. These
creatures reproduce rapidly and often carry diseases that have re-
sulted in more than one great plague.

There are two prominent varieties of rat. The first is the black
rat. These are about 8 inches long (lean bodied) when fully grown
with a tail at least as long as its body, a pointed nose, and long
ears. This “black rat” is dark gray in color with brownish patches
above and gray and white coloring on its underbelly. It is an ex-
cellent climber and jumper (climb 3), but it cannot swim.

The second variety is the brown rat, also known as the sewer
rat, the wharf rat, and the Norway rat. It varies in length between
5 and 10 inches long and its tail is shorter than the black rat's. Its
eyes and ears are also smaller, but it has a larger, fatter body,
Brown rats may be gray, white, black, or pied in color. They can-
not climb, but are excellent swimmers (swim 3) and burrowers. If
rats infest a building, black rats will inhabit the upper floors,
while brown rats will occupy the lower floor and the cellars.

Combat: While rats normally flee from anything bigger than
themselves, a trapped rat will do anything to survive and a pack
of starving rats will attack anything in order to feed. Rats attack
with their two sharp front teeth, which inflict one point of dam-
age per bite. Worse, a rat often carries diseases, so that a rat bite
has a 5% chance of infecting its victim with a serious disease un-
less a successful save versus poison is made. Normal rats fear fire,
but will brave it if they are very hungry.

A swarm of rats can be treated as a single “monster,” having an
assigned number of Hit Dice and inflicting a set amount of dam-
age each round automatically on small creatures in the swarm’s
area. A typical pack might cover a 10'x10’ area, have four Hit
Dice, and inflict four points of damage per round. Weapons have
minimal effect on a pack but area effect spells and certain other
attacks (such as flaming oil) are effective. When the pack has lost
its hit points, it is considered to be dispersed and unable to inflict
mass damage.

Habitat/Society: The chief goal of a pack of rats is to find food.
Packs have been frequently known to burrow into food stores
and devour them. Rats will nest virtually anywhere, chewing on
cloth, paper, and wood in the course of nestmaking.

 

 

 

 

 

Ecology: Rats are extremely prolific, breeding three to five
times a year. Brown rats produce eight to 14 young per litter,
while black rats produce only five to six young in a litter. Black
and brown rats are omnivorous, eating plant and animal life.
Brown rats are considered to be more aggressive than black rats.
Their teeth are extremely powerful; they have been known to
gnaw holes in lead pipes. Rats have a lifespan of two to four
years.

Brush Rats

Brush rats (also known as trade rats and pack rats) belong to a
much less aggressive family of rats known as wood rats. Their
coloring is slate gray above and white on their underbellies. They
are nearly the size of brown rats. Brush rats build nests or bur-
rows in forested areas. They are attracted to small, bright, shiny
objects and will sometimes steal them and carry them off to their
hoard. Pack rats are herbivores and will not attack humans. They
do not carry diseases. Brush rats can be trained.

Giant Rats

Also known as Sumatran rats, these vile beasts plague under-
ground areas such as crypts and dungeons. Their burrows honey-
comb many graveyards, where they cheat ghouls of their prizes
by tunneling to newly interred corpses. Giant rats are brown-
black in color with white underbellies, and are related to the
brown rat, with fatter bodies and shorter tails. As with normal
rats, any creature bitten by a giant rat has a 5% chance per
wound of catching a debilitating disease; a successful saving
throw versus poison will prevent catching the disease. Giant rats
avoid attacking strong parties unless driven by hunger or com-
manded by creatures such as vampires and wererats. Giant rats
are fearful of fire and flee from it except if driven by hunger or
magic. They are excellent swimmers and can attack in water as
well as on land.

Rays, also known as sea bats, are native to warm tropical shallow wa-
ters. They are broad, flat creatures, with eyes on the upper, dark-
colored surface of their body and the mouth and gills on the lighter
underbelly. Their pectoral fins are huge, which gives them a batlike
appearance, and they use their short tail as a rudder. They feed on
mollusks and crustaceans and only rarely attack humans, with the ex-
ception of the malevolent ixitxachitl. These long, flat creatures bury
themselves in the silt and sand of the sea floor in order to surprise
their prey.

Manta Ray

These huge creatures, which weigh as much as 3,000 pounds, bury
themselves in the ocean floor waiting for victims to arrive. The manta
has a giant maw (10 to 12 feet across) that can totally engulf any crea-
ture man-sized or smaller in a single bite. If the manta’s hit roll is 2 or
more greater than the number it needed to hit (e.g., rolls a 16 or better
when it could hit on a 14), then it has swallowed its prey. Swallowed
creatures die at the end of six rounds. Any creature swallowed can at-
tack from inside the ray at -4 with a dagger or a short sword (other
weapons require too much space to wield effectively); the ray’s Ar-
mor Class remains the same. A manta ray can swallow but one man-
sized creature or three size S creatures at once.

If creatures attack its rear, it can use its stinger instead of its bite. If
it strikes, the victim suffers 2-20 points of damage and must save ver-
sus paralyzation or be stunned for 2-8 rounds.

The manta ray’s stomach may contain treasure.

Pungi Ray

The tropical pungi rays conceal themselves in the sand of the ocean
floor with their terrible back spines protruding. Their spines are
greenish or brown, resembling plant growth so closely as to be 90%
undistinguishable from normal seaweed. Pungi rays are 15 feet across
and 6 feet long. Their back spines are in a 3 foot by 4 foot area, with
‘one spine per square foot (12 in total). Any creature stepping on a

2+2 HD vampiric 270

pungi spine must save versus poison or die instantly. A footstep on a
pungi ray equals one attack; if a creature fell on a pungi ray it would
suffer 2-8 spinal attacks. If a pungi ray is attacked it will try to swim
away.

Sting Ray

These bottom-feeding creatures are found swimming on the ocean
floor in shallow waters. If any creature steps on one, the ray lashes
out with its tail spine, inflicting 1-3 points damage; any creature
struck must also save versus poison or be paralyzed for 5-20 turns,
suffering points of damage equal to the number of turns of paralysis.

Ixitxachitl

The ixitxachit] (pronounced icks-it-ZACH-it-ul) are an intelligent
race of evil manta rays. They have their own language and worship
evil powers. These cruel creatures love to hunt marine humanoids
and sacrifice or devour any they catch. Communities of 10 to 100 ix-
itxachitl live in coral reef mazes with a secret entrance. For every 10,
there is one ixitxachitl equal to a 2nd level priest. For every 20, there is
one equal to a 3rd level priest. For every 50, there is a 2 +2 Hit Dice
priest with Sth level ability. If there are more than 50, there will be a
leader with 4+4 Hit Dice and 8th level cleric ability and two guards
with 3 +3 Hit Dice and 6th level ability. Spheres include Charm, Divi-
nation, Elemental (water), Healing, Necromantic, Protection, and
Sun (darkness only). Guards and leaders have treasure type U that
can be used without hands. For every 20 encountered there is a 50%
chance that one is a vampiric ixitxachitl (double Hit Dice, drains one
energy level per hit, and regenerates 3 hit points per round).

Remorhaz, sometimes known as polar worms, inhabit only chill
arctic wastes. They are very aggressive predators that devour any
animal matter, including humans, demihumans, and humanoids;
they have even been known to attack frost giants.

A remorhaz has a segmented body with a winged head and
neck, standing on dozens of chitinous legs. Remorhaz have an ice
blue color everywhere except on their backs, where a streak of
white sets off the many protrusions located there. The size of a re-
morhaz is determined by its Hit Dice: a 7 Hit Dice remorhaz is 21
feet long, an 8 Hit Dice creature is 24 feet long, etc. Their lan-
guage consists of roaring, bellowing, and howling.

Combat: In combat the remorhaz beats its small wings, raising
up the front quarter of its body. It then snaps itself forward, strik-
ing with blinding speed. They are able to swallow prey whole on
an unmodified attack roll of 20; any victim swallowed is killed in-
stantly by the intense heat inside the creature. When aroused, the
remorhaz secretes a substance that causes its intestines to become
very hot and its back protrusions actually glow cherry red from
excess heat. Any nonmagical weapon melts from contact with its
back and any creature touched by these surfaces suffers 10-100
points of damage.

To determine where a blow has struck a remorhaz, consider
where the attacker is in respect to the remorhaz. While the re-
morhaz is rearing to attack, a blow from the front hits the rela-
tively soft underbelly. When the remorhaz is attacking a creature,
any blow inflicted hits the head unless the underside is specifically
stated as the object of the attack. In all other cases, the body is the
object of the attack, subject to adjudication by the DM.

Remorhaz are slower than most polar dwellers, so they prefer
to burrow into the snow and surface when they hear prey nearby,
hoping to achieve surprise. Remorhaz have infravision to 60 feet.

Habitat/Society: A remorhaz lair usually consists of a number
of large, smoothly rounded tunnels in ice and snow or rock, grad-
ually descending to a large central chamber. Tunnels in ice and
snow will be very slippery, as the remorhaz’s hot back repeatedly

 

   
 

 

 

 

melts the snow, leaving it to refreeze. The central chamber is only
about twice the size of a remorhaz, while the central chamber of a
nesting pair is about four times their size and may contain icy sta-
lactites.

Remorhaz have a hunting range of 60 miles. Except where the
game has been hunted to extinction, these creatures tolerate the
presence of other remorhaz in their hunting grounds.

Ecology: Remorhaz are carnivores, sustaining themselves with
a diet of deer, elk, and even polar bears. They mate in late sum-
mer and stay together for two months before departing to live sol-
itary existences. Remorhaz mate every year but can produce
offspring only three or four times in a lifetime; the female lays a
clutch of one or two grey-blue eggs, remaining with the eggs at all
times, coiling around them to keep them warm; if the eggs are left
in the freezing cold for only one minute, they will never hatch.
Young remorhaz have 1 Hit Die at birth and grow to 7 Hit Dice af-
ter four months, when they leave the nest. Immature remorhaz
have weaker armor (+2 AC in all locations); 1-3 Hit Dice re-
morhaz can only bite for 2-12 points of damage, while 4-6 Hit
Dice creatures inflict 3-18 points of damage. From birth, the
young remorhaz have all the powers of an adult.

Remorhaz have lifespans of 30 years. Their eggs are valued at
500 gold pieces and are eagerly sought because these creatures can
be trained to be excellent guards. However, a remorhaz can be
trained to obey only one or two masters, and will attack its mas-
ter if hungry enough. The heat secretion of a rhemorhaz, thrym,
is valuable as a component for heat-related magical items and can
be sold to alchemists for 5-10 gold pieces per flask. The remorhaz
will contain 10 flasks worth of thrym per Hit Die.

Also called fauns, satyrs are a pleasure-loving race of half-
human, half-goat creatures usually dwelling in sylvan settings.
Symbolizing nature's wild and carefree ways, an encounter witha
satyr can be benign.

Satyrs have the torso, head, and arms of a man, and the hind
legs of a goat. The human head is surmounted by two sharp horns
that poke through the satyr's coarse, curly hair. The skin of the
upper body ranges from tan to light brown, with a rare (1%)
breed known to be red. Its hair is medium, reddish, or dark
brown. The horns and hooves are black.

These creatures have their own tongue and are also able to
speak sylvan elvish and common. Satyrs dwelling near centaurs
are 80% likely to be friendly with them, cooperating with them
and speaking their language. Rarely (5%), satyrs can be found as-
sociating with a group of korred.

Combat: Satyrs are very silent and have keen senses, so they
have a +2 bonus on their surprise rolls. They can blend with foli-
age so as to be 90% undetectable to creatures not able to see hid-
den or invisible things. Satyrs have infravision to 60 feet.

A satyr normally attacks by butting with its two sharp horns.
They will occasionally (20%) make use of +1 magic weapons, es-
pecially long or short swords, daggers, and short bows. It is quite
likely that a satyr will first play a tune on its pipes, an instrument
only a satyr can properly employ. By means of these pipes, the sa-
tyr can charm, sleep, or cause fear in all within 60 feet unless they
save versus spell.

Only one satyr per band is likely to have these pipes. If comely
females (Charisma 15+) are in the group, the piping will be to
charm. Should the intruders be relatively inoffensive, the piping
will put them to sleep and the satyr will steal all of the victims’
choice food and drink, as well as items such as rings, amulets,
staves, and weapons. If the intruders are hostile, the piping will
be used to cause fear. The effects of the piping will last for 1-6
hours or until dispelled. Any creature that saves versus any form
of piping is not affected by additional music from the same pipes
in that encounter. A bard's singing can nullify the pipe’s music be-
fore it takes effect if he announces that this as his sole action.

Habitat/Society: Satyrs inhabit only sylvan woodlands. They
are interested only in sport: frolicking, piping, chasing wood
nymphs, and so on. They resent intrusion, however, and will
drive away any creature that offends them. A lucky wanderer

 

    

 

 

 

 

 

may stumble on a woodland celebration, which will comprise an
equal number of dryads and fauns plus 3-24 other woodland crea-
tures and a 25% chance of 2-12 centaurs. Strangers are welcomed
only if they contribute some good victuals and drink to the party,
especially superior (10+ gp per bottle) wine. Such wine can also
be used to lure or bribe satyrs. If a group of interlopers includes
elves, the group has a better chance of being welcomed.

These celebrations can last all night in the spring and summer
months, with newcomers waking up the next morning with mas-
sive headaches, minus a few valuables, and not a woodland crea-
ture (nor their tracks) to be found.

Shying away from the trappings of an organized society, a col-
ony of satyrs usually includes young numbering 50% of the
adults. Satyrs dwell in comfortable caves and hollow trees. There
are no female satyrs and most sages believe that dryads are the fe-
male counterparts of the satyr. It is believed that satyrs mate with
dryads to produce more satyrs and dryads. Satyrs share the dry-
ads’ affection for humans of the opposite sex, but whereas a man
charmed by a dryad may return in several years (if ever), a female
charmed by a satyr might return after 1-4 weeks.

Satyrs are an inoffensive race that just wishes to have fun.
They rarely venture more than 10 miles from their communities,
most often doing so to gather food. They are fond of venison and
small game but also eat plants and fruits.

Ecology: Satyrs hunting in sylvan woodlands keep game ani-
mal populations at normal levels; satyrs never hunt to excess or
despoil plants.

Giant scorpions are vicious predators that live almost anywhere,
including relatively cold places such as dungeons, though they fa-
vor deserts and warm lands. These creatures are giant versions of
the normal 4-inch-long scorpion found in desert climes.
The giant scorpion has a green carapace and yellowish green
legs and pincers. The segmented tail is black, with a vicious
__ stinger on the end. There is a bitter smell associated with the scor-
_ pion, which probably comes from the venom. They make an un-
nerving scrabbling sound as they travel across dungeon floors.

_ Combat: The giant scorpion is 95% likely to attack any creature
that approaches. The creature has a hard, chitinous carapace that
gives it Armor Class 3. This monster attacks by grabbing prey with
its two huge pincers, inflicting 1-10 points of damage each, while it
lashes forward with its tail to sting. Thus, it can fight three oppo-

nents at once. If a giant scorpion manages to grab a victim in a pin-
cer, it will automatically inflict 1-10 points of damage each round
until it releases the victim. The victim has but one chance to escape.
If he can make his bend bars/lift gates roll, he will escape the claw.
However, this can be the character's only action that round and it
can be tried only once per combat. If the sting is employed against
an untrapped victim, an attack roll is required for a successful at-
tack, but a trapped character is automatically struck by any sting
attack directed at him with no attack roll required.

The sting inflicts 1-4 points of damage and the victim must save
versus poison or die the next round (type F). Note that scorpions
are not immune to their own poison. If a scorpion is reduced to 1
or 2 hit points, it will go into a stinging frenzy, stinging everything
in sight, gaining two attempts to hit per round with only the tail.
Slain creatures are dragged to the scorpion’s burrow to be eaten.

Habitat/Society: Giant scorpions live in underground burrows
or dungeons. Each lair may (20%) have 5d4 scorpion eggs. These
beasts eat any living creature that is unfortunate enough to stray
too close to their lair. Any treasure found comes from the bodies
of human or demihuman victims that have been dragged here to
be consumed. Armor is rarely found intact, since the scorpion
will surely have used its pincers to cut up its prey.

Ecology: These bizarre insects contribute to the ecosystem by
feeding on other giant versions of insects such as spiders and ants.
They themselves are prey for purple worms and other huge, sub-
terranean creatures. Alchemists and assassins prize the scorpion’s
venom because of its potency.

Large and Huge Scorpions

Often found in dungeons and wildernesses, these creatures are
merely smaller versions of the giant scorpion. Colors range from
tan to brown to black, and rumors persist of rare white scorpions
deep underground. All attack with pincers and tail stinger. If struck
by the stinger, the victim must save versus poison or die the next
round. However, the poison of the large scorpion is weaker than
normal (type A, 15/0 points damage), giving the victim a +2 on
his saving throw. Huge scorpions have deadly (type F) poison and
can pin a victim in a way similar to the giant scorpion, but with the
huge scorpion, the victim can still fight back. It is not unusual to see
scorpions of various sizes fighting with each other.

Selkies are seal-like beings that have the ability to change into hu-
man form for a few days at a time.

When in their true, seal-like forms, they are nearly indistin-
guishable from normal seals. Close inspection of their arms, how-
ever, will reveal the presence of slightly webbed hands instead of
fore flippers and legs instead of a tapering body and rear flippers.
Once a month, each selkie is able to assume human form for
about a week. Usually selkies prefer to briefly visit the realm of
men (which they call the “overworld”) out of curiosity, but some-
times they are ordered to go forth and purchase desperately
needed supplies or information. When in human form, selkies are
very attractive indeed and their fine looks have broken more than
a few overworlders’ hearts. Their eyes are particularly noticeable
as they are always either a bright emerald green or startling light
blue. Since the selkie transformation is not a spell or magical ef-
fect, only spells like true seeing will reveal a selkie’s true nature,
although their peculiar mannerisms and predilection for seafood
also might.

Combat: Since selkies are unable to swim quickly while carry-
ing weapons, 90% of selkies encountered underwater will be un-
armed. They use their sharp teeth whenever they are cornered but
prefer to use their impressive speed underwater to escape superior
odds. If encountered on land, selkies are wise enough to bear hu-
man weapons, most likely swords scavenged from the wrecks of
ships (see below).

Habitat/Society: Selkie communities are divided between male
and female, with females usually outnumbering males, as male
selkies are the hunter/gatherers throughout the often dangerous
waters nearby. However, both aspects of selkie “community” (do-
mestic and provider) are equally respected within the lair, and no
sex is accorded undue privileges.

Selkies inhabit only colder waters and there are both saltwater
and freshwater varieties. Selkies almost always build their lairs in
huge, underwater caverns and grottos containing both air and
water-filled regions— selkie young must be raised in an air-filled
environment for about their first year.

As mentioned earlier, selkies often find and explore wrecks of
sunken treasure. Most selkie communities have hoarded at least
some booty (especially pearls), keeping those otherwise useless
trinkets only for purposes of trade with the overworld. Only

 

 

 

 

 

selkies who have visited the overworld many times have ever ac-
quired a taste for ornamenting themselves like overworlders, and
can be distinguished from more traditional selkies immediately.
For obvious reasons, these more experienced selkies are often the
best representatives to deal with if one is an overworlder. Selkies
can be hired and have a limited knowledge of overworlder cus-
toms. All magical treasure recovered by selkies is immediately
commandeered for the good of the community and the lair's de-
fense.

Ecology: Selkies are omnivorous, preferring to eat fish, shell-
fish, crustaceans, and various forms of seaweed. Those that have
visited the surface are often partial to human fare as well. Selkies
are particularly susceptible to fine wine, which is to be expected
since these intoxicants are unknown below the seas.

Selkies are sensitive about their environment and harvest only
what they need to survive. It is worth noting that selkie represent-
atives lobby heavily whenever local overworlder environmental
issues threaten selkie existence. Most selkie communities have
learned the value of dropping a few pearls here and there in order
to get what they want from men.

While selkies in human form are quite beautiful, they are fortu-
nate indeed that their pelts have little value in overworlder mar-
kets. They are, therefore, without any special enemies besides
those common to seals and all ocean dwelling beings.

Selkie, Leader

Each venerable leader of a selkie community can cast the follow-
ing spells once per day, one spell per round: augury, cure light
wounds, and cure disease. Leaders can also cast weather sum-
moning and control weather once per week. Selkies fear the
wrath of the sea should they ever use their powers for ill.

Shadows are shadowy, undead creatures that drain strength from
their victims with their chilling touch.

Shadows are 90% undetectable in all but the brightest of sur-
roundings (continual light or equivalent), as they normally ap-
pear to be nothing more than their name would suggest. In bright
light they can be clearly seen.

Combat: As shadows exist primarily on the Negative Material
plane, they have the ability to drain the life force of their victims.
The chilling touch of a shadow inflicts 2-5 points of damage to its
victim as well as draining one point of Strength. Lost Strength
points return 2-8 turns after being touched. If a human or demi-
human opponent is reduced to zero Strength or zero hit points by
a shadow, the shadow has drained the life force and the opponent
becomes a shadow as well. The newly formed shadow is then
compelled to join the roving band and pursue a life of evil. Other
living creatures simply collapse from fatigue (if taken to zero
Strength) or fall unconscious (if taken to zero hit points), where
they are left to die or are hounded again upon waking.
Shadows are immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells and are
unaffected by cold-based attacks. They can be turned by clerics.

Habitat/Society: Shadows travel in loosely organized packs
that freely roam ancient ruins, graveyards, and dungeons. They
specialize in terrifying their victims.

Shadows have no leaders and thus spend much of their time
roaming aimlessly about their chosen surroundings. Contrary to
popular belief, shadows do not hoard treasure. In fact, such
earthly baubles only help to remind the creatures of their former
lives. Instead, the furious undead throw all of the treasure they
find away in the same location (often at the bottom of a well or
deep pit), where it is out of sight of the band. It is therefore specu-
lated that the removal of a shadow hoard would be quite easy
(even welcomed), were it not for the fact that shadows attack liv-
ing beings without hesitation, regardless of their intent or threat.

Ecology: According to most knowledgeable sages, shadows ap-
pear to have been magically created, perhaps as part of some an-
cient curse laid upon some long-dead enemy. The curse affects
only humans and demihumans so it would seem that it affects the
soul or spirit. When victims no longer can resist, either through
loss of consciousness (hit points) or physical prowess (Strength

 

 

 

 

 

points), the curse is activated and the majority of the character's
essence is shifted to the Negative Material plane. Only a shadow
of their former self remains on the Prime Material plane, and the
transformation always renders the victim both terribly insane
and undeniably evil.

Attempts to remove the curse from captured shadows have all
failed, thus providing more clues into the nature of the disorder.
A limited wish spell proved only partially successful as the victim
returned for an hour but remained insane for the duration. It has
been recently speculated that a full wish, followed by a heal spell,
might be capable of restoring a shadow to his former state, but
again it must be emphasized that this is only a theory.

Fortunately, shadows rarely leave their lairs, and a bold party
wishing to rescue a lost fighter or wizard should have plenty of
time to venture forth and recover their friend, provided that no
one else explores the lair and slays the unfortunate character
while the shadows are absent.

The original body of a victim is destroyed when changed to a
shadow whether by the curse itself or by unprotected exposure to
the Negative Material plane. In any case, killing a shadow is
merely a case of severing the bond between the Prime Material
and Negative Material forms.

All skeletons are magically animated undead monsters, created as
guardians or warriors by powerful evil wizards and priests.

Skeletons appear to have no ligaments or musculature which
would allow movement. Instead, the bones are magically joined
together during the casting of an animate dead spell. Skeletons
have no eyes or internal organs.

Skeletons can be made from the bones of humans and demihu-
mans, animals of human size or smaller, or giant humanoids like
bugbears and giants.

Combat: Man-sized humanoid skeletons always fight with
weapons, usually a rusty sword or spear. Because of their magical
nature, they do not fight as well as living beings and inflict only 1-
6 points of damage when they hit. Animal skeletons almost al-
ways bite for 1-4 points of damage, unless they would obviously

inflict less (i.e., skeletal rats should inflict only 1-2 points, etc.).
Monster skeletons, always constructed from humanoid crea-
tures, use giant-sized weapons which inflict the same damage as
their living counterparts but without any Strength bonuses.

Skeletons are immune to all sleep, charm, and hold spells. Be-
cause they are assembled from bones, cold-based attacks also do
skeletons no harm. The fact that they are mostly empty means
that edged or piercing weapons (like swords, daggers, and spears)
inflict only half damage when employed against skeletons. Blunt
weapons, with larger heads designed to break and crush bones,
cause normal damage against skeletons. Fire also does normal
damage against skeletons. Holy water inflicts 2-8 points of dam-
age per vial striking the skeleton.

Skeletons are immune to fear spells and need never check mo-
rale, usually being magically commanded to fight to the death.
When a skeleton dies, it falls to pieces with loud clunks and rattles.

Habitat/Society: Skeletons have no social life or interesting
habits. They can be found anywhere there is a wizard or priest
powerful enough to make them. Note that some neutral priests of
deities of the dead or dying often raise whole armies of animated
followers in times of trouble. Good clerics can make skeletons
only if the dead being has granted permission (either before or af-
ter death) and if the cleric’s deity has given express permission to
do so. Otherwise, violating the eternal rest of any being or animal
is something most good deities disapprove of highly.

Skeletons have almost no minds whatsoever, and can obey
only the simplest one- or two-phrase orders from their creators.
Skeletons fight in unorganized masses and tend to botch complex
orders disastrously. It is not unheard of to find more than one
type of skeleton (monsters with animals, animals with humans)
working together to protect their master’s dungeon or tower.

Ecology: Unless the skeleton’s remains are destroyed or scat-
tered far apart, the skeleton can be created anew with the applica-
tion of another animate dead spell. Rumors of high-level animate
dead spells which create skeletons capable of reforming them-
selves to continue fighting after being destroyed have not been re-
liably comfirmed.

Skunks are forest-dwelling omnivores found in most temperate
and subtropical regions. They are easily recognized by the long
white stripe running from their faces, down their black-furred
backs, to the tips of their tails.

Combat: Skunks react to any serious threat by backing toward
the opponent. If the other creature does not quickly get beyond
range, the skunk discharges a vile cloud of stinking musk at it.
The cloud of a normal skunk is 10’x10'x10’. Any creature un-
fortunate enough to be caught in a skunk’s cloud must first save
versus poison or be nauseated (lose 50% of Strength and Dexter-
ity) for 1-4 rounds and retreat and retch. Anyone who makes the
first saving throw, but chooses to remain within the cloud, must
make an additional save versus poison each round he stays. After

 

other items (i.e., flesh, leather, metal,
etc.) must be washed and aired re-
peatedly for several days to remove
the horrid stench. Washing the items
in vinegar will remove the smell in
only a few washings, while certain
spells and magical items can accom-
plish the task quite nicely. A potion of
sweet water poured carefully over the
items to be cleaned will neutralize the
musk in the garments of 2-5 people
(depending on the quantity of gear
and the care used in applying the
fluid). Despite washing, any cloth
that fails its saving throw—including
magical items—will rot and become
useless.

If cornered, skunks can bite, but usually loose their combina-
tion offense/defense musk cloud immediately. If two or more
skunks are encountered, the DM should make careful note of
where their clouds go. While skunks are immune to the nausea ef-
fects of other skunks, they can still be blinded by the acid musk
just like any other living creature.

Habitat/Society: Skunks are wandering scavengers and have no
social structure. They prefer to eat the leftovers of larger preda-
tors and always dwell deep in the forest.

Ecology: Asmentioned above, skunks will eat almost anything,
usually the remains of other kills. Their musk is secreted from a
small posterior sac which is heavily muscled to permit the expul-
sion of the fluid. The fluid forms a heavy mist which lingers in an
area for up to a week or more, depending on the prevailing winds
and area filled. If the skunk is surprised and killed quickly, there is
a 50% chance that the musk will be recoverable. A giant skunk
killed in this way can be a prize worth close to 200 gp to a sage or
alchemist, as the musk is a valued alchemical component (for
stinking cloud scroll ink, smoke bombs, etc.).

Askunk pelt is relatively worthless as a luxury fur. Skunk meat
is bitter and must be heavily seasoned to be palatable.

Skunks can be raised in captivity and make wonderful pets and
combination low-cost garbage disposals/house guards.

Giant Skunks

Giant skunks are simply huge versions of the normal variety.
Their musk clouds tend to be larger and more noxious than those
of their cousins. The cloud is 20 feet wide by 20 feet high by 60
feet long and all saving throws against the musk of a giant skunk
are at a penalty of -4.

There are basically two types of snakes, coming in all manner of
sizes. The poisonous snakes make up for their relatively smaller
size with deadly venoms, while the larger constrictors squeeze their
victims to death. Both types sleep for days after eating.

Constrictor Snakes

Constrictors of all sizes hide in the branches of trees, waiting pa-
tiently until they can slowly lower themselves or suddenly drop
onto their unsuspecting victims. Once the first hit is successful,
the victim is constricted automatically, suffering damage every
round. Constricted humanoid creatures can escape the coils of
normal constrictors with a successful open doors roll (at a-1 pen-
alty). Anyone who attempts to free a captured being by hacking
at the constrictor has a 20% chance of striking the victim instead
(roll damage as usual and apply to the victim's hit point total).
Area spells like fireball will likewise affect both combatants, but
target-specific spells like charm monster and magic missile would
of course be useful.

Giant Constrictor Snakes

Giant constrictors are larger and much stronger than their smaller
cousins. It requires the combined efforts of 60 total points of
Strength (beings from outside joining the coiled victim) to extri-
cate someone from a giant constrictor’s steel grasp.

Poisonous Snakes

All poisonous snakes deliver their poisons automatically through
their bite. Roll on the table below (or choose) to determine what
type of poison is present.

Spitting Poisonous Snakes

Spitting varieties of snakes can both bite their victims and shoot a
spittle of poison at one target within 30 feet. Their poison is iden-
tical to that of normal poisonous snakes (see above).

Giant Poisonous Snakes

Giant poisonous snakes cause death in one round if their victims
fail a saving throw versus poison. Some varieties inflict 3-18
points of damage even if the saving throw succeeds.

Giant Sea Snakes

Found only in tropical waters, the only type of snake that is both
constricting and poisonous is the giant sea snake. Its constricting
grasp on small ships can crush them in about 10 rounds. Sea
snakes attack ships only when they are hungry (20% chance).
Their poisonous bite is deadly in 1-4 rounds.

Spectres are powerful undead that haunt the most desolate and
deserted of places. They hate all life and light.

Spectres appear as semitransparent beings and are often mis-
taken for haunts or ghosts. Unlike most undead, spectres retain
the semblance and manner of dress of their former life and can be
recognized by old friends or through paintings of the persons they
used to be.

Combat: Spectres exist primarily on the Negative Material
plane and can therefore be attacked by beings on the Prime Mate-
rial plane only with magical weapons. Daylight makes spectres
powerless by weakening their ties to the Negative Material plane.

The chilling touch of a spectre drains energy from living crea-
tures. A successful attack inflicts 1-8 points of damage and drains
two life energy levels from the victim. Any being totally drained of
life energy by a spectre becomes a full-strength spectre under the
control of the spectre which drained him. The victim loses all con-
trol of his personality and may become more or less powerful than
before, depending on his level and class before becoming a spectre.

Spectres are immune to all sleep, charm, hold, and cold-based
spells, as well as poisons and paralyzation attacks. Holy water in-
flicts 2-8 points of damage when it strikes a spectre. The water can
be splashed on a spectre successfully. A raise dead spell appar-
ently reverses the undead status, destroying the spectre immedi-
ately if a saving throw versus spell is failed.

Habitat/Society: Most spectres are solitary, but some enclaves
exist where a particularly powerful or lucky spectre has managed

 

 

 

 

 

to drain mortals of life. This lead spectre is known as the master
spectre (always with maximum hit points per die), while the oth-
ers are known collectively as the followers. In this arrangement,
the master spectre almost never engages enemies personally, but
instead sends his minions in for the kill. Mortals drained of life by
follower spectres are subservient to the master spectre, not the
followers. Note that if the master spectre is slain, all followers be-
come independent and can travel anywhere they wish in hopes of
becoming master spectres themselves. Once a character becomes
aspectre, recovery is nearly impossible, requiring a special quest.

Spectres hate light and all life, as both remind them of their un-
dead existence. They are therefore encountered only in places of
extreme darkness and desolation, like long-abandoned ruins,
dungeons, and subterranean sewers.

Contrary to popular mythology, spectres remain highly intelli-
gent and generally rational after the transformation to undeath.
Life makes them lament their unlife, and they bear a strong hatred
for all those lucky enough to live and truly die.

Spectres have enough cunning to plan their attacks, and rival
vampires in their skill at remaining hidden from the general popu-
lace.

Ecology: No one knows who the first spectre was or how it
came to be; the few facts detailed above are all that is known with
any degree of certainty.

All spiders are aggressive predators, dwelling both above and be-
low ground. All of the listed types of spiders are poisonous and
will seek to bite their prey first before taking it back to their webs.

Large Spiders

Large spiders all build strong, sticky webs and often lurk nearby
waiting for victims to get stuck while investigating the beautiful
construction. Any creature stuck in a spider’s web can escape if
given time. A being with a Strength of 19 or greater is unaffected
by the webs. For each point of Strength less than 19, it requires
one round to extricate oneself from the fibers (i.e., someone with
a 15 Strength can break free in four rounds). Meanwhile, of
course, as many spiders as possible will attack the defenseless
character while he tries to free himself. Entangled characters can
be attacked with a +4 bonus to hit, and lose all Armor Class ad-

justments due to Dexterity.

The bite of large spiders can be deadly if a save versus poison is
failed, but the poison (type A, damage 15/0) is relatively weak
and allows a +2 bonus to the roll.

Huge Spiders
Huge spiders prefer to hide in camouflaged tunnels and holes, and
wait to leap as much as 30 feet through the air at their unsuspect-
ing victims; opponents are -6 on their surprise rolls when huge
spiders attack in this manner.

The poison of huge spiders is slightly stronger than the large
spider variety and allows only a +1 bonus to the saving throw.

Giant Spiders
Giant spiders are identical to large spiders, only bigger. Their poi-
son (type F) is deadly if a save versus poison is not made.

Giant Water Spiders

Giant water spiders drag their prey beneath the water to large
nests, where they can safely cocoon their catches for later diges-
tion. Their powerful venom (type F) is deadly if a save versus poi-
son is not made.

Giant Marine Spiders
Giant marine spiders are simply saltwater varieties of the giant
water spider.

Phase Spiders
Phase spiders are web dwellers and have the unique ability of
phasing in and out of the Prime Material plane. They phase in, at-
tack, and phase out, all in a single turn. This gives them a -3 mod-
ifier on initiative rolls. If the phase spiders win the initiative roll
by more than 4 points, they attack and phase out before their op-
ponents get a chance to strike back. Also, phase spiders usually
phase in behind their opponents so they get the +4 modifier for
attacking from behind. On the Ethereal plane, phase spiders get
only a -1 modifier on initiative and can be attacked every round,
regardless of the initiative result. Phase spiders always flee to the
Ethereal plane when outmatched.

The deadly poison (type F) of phase spiders is the strongest of
all the spiders, with a -2 penalty to save.

Sprites are shy and reclusive faerie people who dwell in meadows
and wooded glens. They have distinctly elven features and small,
semitransparent wings.

Combat; Sprites hate all evil and ugliness and are quite capable
of stout militancy should their secluded homes be invaded by orcs
or worse. They fight with long, slim swords which do damage as
a human-size dagger, or their own special bows which have a
range half that of a human short bow and do only half as much
damage (i.e., 1-3 points). The tips of their arrows, however, are
coated with a special ointment concocted especially by the
sprites. Any creature struck by these arrows, regardless of level
or magic resistance, must save versus poison or fall into a deep
sleep lasting 1-6 hours. Normally sprites won't do anything more
than remove their victims to a place very far away (often dispos-
sessing them of weapons in the process), but evil creatures may be
slain.

Sprites can become invisible at will and detect good/evil within
50 yards, so they are hard to deceive, evade, or capture. When in-
visible, sprites get +2 to hit against their bewildered opponents
and are attacked with a -4 penalty to hit.

HabitatSoc ety; Sprites are very flighty, like most faerie-kind,
and are hard to bargain with once they are found. Even the elves
are not fast allies with the sprites, for sprites find elves much too
serious about most woodland affairs.

Only druids, who are sometimes able to magically summon
sprites, deal with these creatures on a regular basis. Some druids
even receive at least some of their training in the company of a
few sprites. In fact, most sprites love druids, for their neutral
alignment and views on evil make them see the forest much the
same.

Sprites are loosely tribal, electing the best warrior among the
group (male or female) as the group spokesman. This leader is
recognized as the one who makes major decisions and bargains
with druids and elves. Sprites rarely wait for their leader's deci-
sion when they should, as any wandering orc starts a race for
glory after the offensive beast. The leader is often left in the back-
wash, just beginning to order the attack.

Ecology: In the typical sylvan setting, sprites have assumed the
task Shmonitoring meadows and glens, and the open expanses of
forests.

 

 

 

 

 

Their sleep ointment is concocted from forest mushrooms. The
ointment must be left to sit in the sun for seven days, and the
sprites have hollowed out many tree stumps as containers for this
rare substance.

Sprites never die unless they are killed, as they are one of the
few races that are truly immortal. Their small size and dangerous
environment keep the sprite population to a minimum.

Fortunately, the sprites keep a watch on their fellow sprites, for
the inevitable gatherings, celebrations, and parties, and a de-
serted meadow or glen is never deserted for more than a decade
before a new clan of sprites moves in.

Sprites usually speak only their own language, common, and
elven, but seem to get along with woodland mammals and other
creatures anyway. In the human world, sprites are sometimes
mistaken for butterflies at a distance, so it is guessed that perhaps
the majority of forest creatures likewise think of the fair sprites in
this way.

Giant toads are found in most regions. Although their smaller cousins
are beneficial insect eaters, the large toads devour (or at least attempt
to devour) any creature which appears edible.

Their exact appearance varies from species to species, but these
beasts are all just what their name implies, giant versions of toads.
Coloration runs the gamut from weak brown to iron red, but their
skin is always dry, rough to the touch, and warty.

Combat: All giant toads can jump up to their movement distance.
This hop will clear any object up to one- third as high as the length of
the leap and requires but a single round to accomplish. A jumping
toad can attack in midair or at the end of the leap.

When hunting, giant toads remain motionless until likely prey
walks or slithers within range. The toad then leaps to the attack; the
victim has a -3 penalty on its surprise roll.

Habitat/Society: Giant toads often make their homes underground,
where they enjoy both the damp air and the steady supply of food.
They prefer temperate zones, near water where they can lay their
eggs, but often survive in surprisingly cool or dry regions.

Toads are often attracted to settled areas where they prey upon live-
stock (goats, chickens, and even sheep). Cities often have problems
with sewer toads, giant monstrosities which have grown fat on ver-
min, house pets, and, occasionally, civil engineers.

Ecology: Giant toads keep no treasure, but worthwhile indigestibles
are occasionally found in their droppings. Their skin can be fashioned
into suitable leather armor, but its odor will be at least as distinctive
as its appearance.

Fire Toad

These large, red toads are about 4 feet long and covered with rough,
purple warts. Fire toads shun water, preferring drier surroundings.
Fire toads are so named because of their ability to exhale small fire-
balls. These fireballs are their only form of attack; a single fireball can
travel up to 30 feet and has a blast radius of 5 feet. Damage is equal to
2-16 points, half that if a saving throw versus spell is made. Fire toads
rarely attack unless threatened, molested, or defending their lairs.
Fire toads subtract 1 point of damage on all dice for fire-based attacks
against them, but cold- or water-based attacks inflict an additional
point of damage per die. Throwing liquid—even water—at a fire toad
will cause it to retreat, though it will immediately breathe twice at its
assailant in the round of its retreat.

Ice Toad

Fully intelligent, ice toads dwell in cold climes or far beneath the sur-
face of the ground. In addition to its vicious bite, the creature can ra-
diate cold in a 10-foot radius from its body. Ice toads can generate this
special attack once every other round. All noncold-using creatures
within this sphere of cold suffer 3-18 points of damage. Characters
making a saving throw versus spell suffer only half damage. Ice toads
speak their own weird language and actively collect gems and jewelry,
particularly diamonds.

Poisonous Toad

These toads, indistinguishable from common giant toads, secrete a
weak, hemotoxic poison. A creature bitten by a poisonous toad must
save versus poison at +2. Failure means the victim falls comatose and
will die within 24 hours unless treated.

Treants are strangely related to both humans and trees, combin-
ing features of both species. Peaceful by nature, treants can cause
great damage when roused to anger. They hate evil things and the
unrestrained use of fire.

Treants are almost indistinguishable from trees. Their skin is a
thick, textured, brown bark. Their arms are gnarled like branches
and their legs fit together when standing like the trunk of a tree.
Above the eyes and along the head are dozens of smaller branches
from which hang great leaves. In winter the leaves of a treant
change color but rarely fall out. Treants are very intelligent and
often speak a number of languages including their own, elf,
dwarf, common, and a smattering of just about all other human-
oid tongues (at least enough to say “Get out of my trees!”).

Combat: The combat ability of treants varies with their size.
Young treants (13 or 14 feet) have 7 or 8 Hit Dice and inflict 2-16
points of damage per attack. Middle-aged treants (15 or 16 feet)
have 9 or 10 Hit Dice, respectively, and inflict 3-18 points of dam-
age per attack. Elder treants (17 or 18 feet) have 11 or 12 Hit Dice
and inflict 4-24 points of damage per attack.

Due to their tough, barklike skin, treants have a superior Ar-
mor Class rating against almost all weapons. Their only weak-
ness is fire. Any fire-based attack against a treant is at +4 to hit
and +1 damage. In addition, treants save against all fire-based
attacks at -4. This weakness to fire also applies to animated trees
controlled by a treant.

Treants have the ability to animate normal trees. One treant
can animate up to two trees. It takes one round for a normal tree
to uproot itself. Thereafter the animated tree can move at a rate of
3 per turn and fights as a full-grown treant (12 Hit Dice, two at-
tacks, 4-24 points of damage per attack). A treant must be within
60 yards of the tree it is attempting to animate. Animated trees
lose their ability to move if the treant who animated them is inca-
pacitated or moves more than 60 yards away.

Treants (regardless of size) and treant-controlled trees can in-
flict structural damage when attacking a building or fortification.

Habitat/Society: Treants live in small communities, usually
amidst old hardwood forests (oak, maple, mahogany, etc.). In the
forest treants rarely reveal themselves, preferring not to interact

 

 

 

 

with the more transient lifeforms (anything with a lifespan of 500
years or less). Humans and demihumans have only a slight
chance of spotting a treant who is trying to blend in with the
trees. Rangers have a fair chance of spotting a treant (10% per
level).

Treants are intolerant of evil, particularly when fire and the
wanton destruction of trees is involved. They hate orcs and gob-
lins with a passion and tend to be suspicious of anyone carrying
an ax.

Treants have no use for treasure, and usually place all such
items somewhere out of sight, such as under a great rock. Occa-
sionally a treant can be convinced to give up his treasure but only
when some great good will be accomplished by this generosity.

Ecology: Treants, like all trees, gain sustenance via photosyn-
thesis. Treants often sleep for long periods of time (anywhere
from a few days to several years) during which short roots grow
into the ground beneath them gathering water and minerals from
the soil. Reproduction is via off-shoot stalks which the female
treants then protect and care for until the stalks are grown.

The lifespan of a treant is not known, but is several thousand
years at least. As they grow older, treants become slower and less
agile, sleeping for longer periods and talking less of things that are
and more of things that were. Eventually an old treant will not
wake up, taking permanent root in the spot where he sleeps and
living out the rest of his life as a normal tree.

Trolls are horrid carnivores found in all climes, from arctic waste-
lands to tropical jungles. Most creatures avoid these beasts, since
trolls know no fear and attack unceasingly when hungry—which is
most of the time.

Trolls grow to heights of 9 feet or more. The physical frame appears
thin and frail, but trolls possess surprising strength and can bend steel
bars with their bare hands. Their arms and legs are long and ungainly.
The legs end in great three-toed feet, the arms in wide, powerful
hands with sharpened claws. Rubbery hide serves as skin. Its color is
nauseating moss green, mottled green and gray, or putrid gray. A
writhing hairlike mass grows from their skulls and is usually greenish
black or iron gray in color, Their dull, sunken black eyes possess ex-
cellent infravision (90 feet). Females are easily distinguished from
males as they are both larger and more powerful than their male
counterparts.

Trolls walk upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders.

The gait is uneven and, when running, the arms dangle free and often
drag along the ground. For all this seeming awkwardness, trolls are
extremely agile. They are masterful climbers and can scale even sheer
cliffs with an 80% chance of success. Trolls have a poor sense of hear-
ing, but their sense of smell is superior.

Trolls have no language of their own, but use “trollspeak” —a dis-
gusting guttural mishmash of common, giant, goblin, orc, and hob-
goblin. Trollspeak is highly transient and trolls from one area are only
25% likely to be able to communicate with trolls from another area.
Trolls live for 100 years or more.

Combat: Trolls attack with two clawed hands and their bite. Due to
their agility trolls can direct these three attacks at multiple opponents.
In the rare case that a troll wields a weapon, it attacks witha +5 dam-
age bonus.

The rubbery skin of trolls regenerates at a phenomenal rate. Start-
ing just three rounds after a troll is first wounded, the creature will re-
cover 3 hit points per round until fully healed. Trolls reduced to zero
or fewer hit points fall to the ground, incapacitated but not slain.

Incapacitated trolls continue to regenerate and will stand up to
fight as soon as they have positive hit points (1 or more).

When using an edged weapon it is possible to sever the thin, rub-
bery limbs of a troll (any natural roll of 20 with an edged weapon sev-
ers one limb). Severed limbs continue to fight even after separation
from the body (arms will claw, heads will bite if stepped on, etc.). At-
tacks by severed limbs are at normal chances to hit. Separated limbs
fight for the remainder of the battle, then scuttle back and rebind with
the main body once the fighting is over. Those limbs which cannot
reach the body die in 24 hours, but this is of little consequence since
trolls can regenerate any lost body parts (including the head) within a
week. If a troll is dismembered and the pieces widely scattered, only
the largest piece survives to regenerate. The others die within a few
days if they cannot rejoin the largest piece.

Only fire and acid cause permanent damage to trolls. These two
forms of attack destroy its regenerative ability. A troll who is reduced
to zero or fewer hit points and is totally immersed in acid or com-
pletely burned with fire is permanently killed.

Understandably, trolls have no fear of death, and launch them-
selves into combat with reckless abandon, flailing wildly at their op-
ponents and biting whoever comes closest. They usually use no
weapons but will occasionally (25%) throw stones before closing
with their victims. These stones have a maximum range of 20 yards,
weigh 10 to 20 pounds each, and inflict 1-8 points of damage. Trolls
stand stationary when throwing stones.
 

Troll

If confronted by a large natural or magical fire (such as a burning
barricade or fire wall) trolls usually try to find some way around the
flames.

Trolls combine a ravenous appetite with limited intelligence. As
such, trolls are frequently distracted and break off pursuit 50% of the
time to pick up food dropped by fleeing prey.

Habitat/Society: Trolls can survive in all climes, but prefer dense
forests and subterranean locales as bright sunlight hurts their eyes
(trolls suffer no combat penalties because of this). They usually lair in
caves, using great boulders to block the entrance and thus avoiding
unwanted guests. Inside a troll cave will be a number of rough nests
made of straw and grass, plus scattered bones and treasure from vic-
tims. If there are no caves in an area, trolls dig themselves a “troll-
hole” and cover its opening with twigs and leaves. Troll-holes are
usually built near trees and are 90% undetectable. Anyone unfortu-
nate enough to step on a troll-hole is 75% likely to fall through the
leafy door and tumble down into the troll den below.

Trolls live in small packs of three to 12 trolls, led by a dominant fe-
male who acts as shaman/chieftain. Priest spells are cast at 7th level;
spheres typically include Charm, Divination, Sun (darkness only),
and Weather. Leadership is retained by combat, so fights for pack
control are frequent. Often trolls will rend each other limb from limb
but, thanks to their regenerative ability, these battles are never fatal.
Still, it is the custom of trolls to toss the loser’s head a great distance
from the fight scene, and frequently losers must sit and stew for a
week until their new head grows back.

The duties of a troll pack chieftain are few. She leads them on their
nightly forages, loping along, sniffing the air for prey. If a scent is
caught the trolls charge off, tearing through undergrowth and bound-
ing over rocks, racing to get there first, and letting out a great cry
once the prey is spotted.

In return for being the hunt leader, the she-troll gets her choice of
mates in the pack. Females give birth to a single troll about once every
five years.

Trolls have ravenous appetites, devouring everything from simple
gtubs to bears, humans, and demihumans. Troll packs remain in an
area, using the same lair or troll-hole, as long as game remains plenti-
ful. Their lairs are often located near human settlements or along well
traveled roads, but not too near, for even trolls respect organized re-
sistance by fire-bearing humans and demihumans. Wandering trolls,
in search of a new lair, travel by night and sleep by day. Ravenous
from walking, these troll packs will, on occasion, attack and devour
entire human or demihuman villages.

About 10% of the troll packs encountered are led by a she-troll of
high intelligence—a quite intelligent troll, indeed. These troll packs
make wilier opponents, relying on ambushes, and often hunting hu-
mans and demihumans deliberately. Troll packs led by such a she-troll
have been known to ally themselves with more powerful evil crea-
tures (such as wizards or giants), or occasionally subjugate lesser
creatures (orcs and goblins) and use them for their own evil ends. In-
dividual trolls are also sometimes found in orc lairs.

Ecology: Trolls prey on all but the most powerful of creatures. They
greatly respect and fear dragons (particularly red and black dragons)
but hate all giants of good alignment and war with them frequently.

The sickly green blood of a troll is used by alchemists to manufac-
ture both poison antidotes and healing potions. The blood from one
troll can make up to three such potions of one type or the other. The
blood of one troll is valued at 400 gold pieces or more.

Giant Two-Headed Troll

These ferocious troll/ettin crossbreeds stand at least 10 feet tall and
have two heads. Their skin is a mottled greenish brown and their
dress is usually moth-eaten rags or animal skins. Two-headed trolls
use trollspeak as their language.

Though part ettin, these monsters retain many of the abilities of
trolls. They regenerate like true trolls, but at a slower rate—only 1 hit
point per round—and severed limbs cannot reattach (but their thicker
limbs are not hacked off on a roll of 20). Two-headed trolls attack

with two claws and two bites. Both bite attacks are directed against
one opponent, but the claws may be directed against different foes.
The troll might (rarely) wield a weapon, with a +6 damage bonus.
Like ettins, two-headed trolls are hardly ever surprised; they are sur-
prised only on a 1. These creatures lair in damp underground caverns
and are occasionally found leading a group of their smaller troll cous-
ins. No female giant two-headed trolls have ever been reported.

Freshwater Troll (Scrag)

These gilled trolls, also called scrags or river trolls, are the most loath-
some of all troll-kind, cunning as well as powerful. River trolls, as
their name implies, travel the waterways in search of victims. Smaller
than other trolls, scrags are, nevertheless, over 8 feet tall. Their arms
are thin and frail but their mouths are wide and lined with dozens of
needle-sharp fangs. Color of the river troll ranges from blue-green to
olive. Scrags have all of the abilities of normal trolls; however, they
regenerate only when immersed in fresh water. Even though they
have gills, scrags can survive out of water for short periods (one hour
or less) and often come ashore in search of prey. River trolls will de-
vour anything they catch, but they prefer humans and demihumans
and have a great fondness for dwarves.

Scrags are devious hunters and often carry a few baubles with
them. They lay the gems near the water's edge, then wait for someone
to spot them and reach down. Other traps include burying themselves
in the sand in shallow water and waiting to be stepped on, tangling
the rudders of small boats, and so forth. River trolls occasionally lair
beneath bridges or near ferry boats and then demand a toll in ex-
change for passage. This toll varies, but is usually along the line of
one cow per week per troll. Livestock and children frequently disap-
pear when river trolls are in an area. Scrag shamans also have access
to Elemental (water) spells. Their exact lifespan is unknown but be-
lieved to be in excess of 150 years.

Saltwater Troll (Marine Scrag)

Like freshwater scrags, marine scrags can breathe air for short periods
(one hour or less) and have all of the abilities of normal trolls, except
they regenerate only when immersed in saltwater. Large (10 feet tall
or more), green, and pot-bellied, marine scrags are thick-skinned and
heavily scaled. Limp seaweed-colored hair hangs down to their shoul-
ders. Their feet are both wide and webbed to aid in swimming. While
their limbs are shorter and weaker than those of ordinary trolls, the
mouth is larger and filled with hundreds of needle-sharp teeth. Ma-
rine scrags can subsist on fish and shellfish, but crave human flesh.
They usually lair in shallow ocean caves or directly beneath city
docks. From there they emerge at night, climbing over ship railings in
search of sailors or hunting the piers for a strolling couple or lone
drunk. Their attacks are always quick and stealthy. Marine scrags
usually hunt in groups of four to six, but occasionally, if the weather
is bad, several dozen may attack a large ship. More than one ship has
been smashed on rocks while fighting off scrags, leaving the survivors
to swim home through troll-infested waters. Marine scrag shamans
also have access to Elemental (water) spells.

Umber hulks are powerful subterranean predators whose ironlike
claws allow them to burrow through solid stone in search of prey.

Umber hulks are tremendously strong, standing nearly 8 feet
tall and over 5 feet wide. Muscles bulge beneath their thick, scaly
hides and their powerful arms and legs all carry great claws. They
have no necks to speak of, but the head features a powerful maw
with rows of triangular teeth and 8-inch mandibles capable of bit-
ing through any hide or bone. Most peculiar of all are the four
round eyes, spaced evenly across each umber hulk’s forehead.
Umber hulks are black, shading to a lighter shade of yellowish
gray on the front. Their eyes are mere blackened dots each the
size of a small coin. Umber hulks have their own language.

Combat: For all of their monstrous features, umber hulks are
intelligent opponents. They usually dig to a point adjacent to a

   

See below

L (8' tall, 5’ wide)
Elite (13)

   

rowing rate varies from 10 feet per
turn in solid stone to 60 feet per turn
in soft earth.

In melee, umber hulks can deliver a
vicious bite but, understandably,
their main weapon is their great
claws. Worse, looking into an umber
hulk’s eyes causes confusion, as per
the spell, unless a saving throw versus
spell is made. In addition to this spe-
cial confusion attack the outer eyes of
an umber hulk provide the creature
with infravision to a distance of 90
feet.

The one saving grace when fighting
an umber hulk is their speed. Their gait is slow and ponderous
and their balance is poor in wide spaces.

Umber hulks never fight to the death unless cornered (which is
rare, since the creature can dig through stone). If hard pressed, an
umber hulk won't hesitate to cause a cave-in (25% chance of suc-
cess per round) and then dig his way to freedom.

Habitat/Society: Umber hulks dwell in the depths of the earth.
They raid dungeons for food, much the way anteaters raid ant colo-
nies, eating their fill and then moving on to let the “colony” recover.

Umber hulks are usually solitary hunters. Males and females
mate, then go their separate ways. One to three young are born
about a year later in a special nursery which has been hollowed
out by the female. Two years later, once the hulklings are big
enough, the female begins taking them with her when hunting. It
is during this period that unfortunate victims may stumble across
more than one umber hulk at a time.

No umber hulk culture is known, but it is rumored that there
may be entire cities of these beings underground with tunnels that
radiate out, like threads in a spider's web, toward the nearer
dungeons and mountain ranges. If true, this would explain much,
for umber hulks seem to disappear or spring up in a region at will
and always take great care in hiding their tunnels behind them.

Ecology: Umber hulks eat young purple worms, ankhegs, and
similar creatures. Their favorite prey, however, is humankind.

Vodyanoi

These aquatic predators are closely related to the umber hulk. Vo-
dyanoi live in deep bodies of fresh water. They are similar in ap-
pearance to umber hulks but have only two eyes and thus lack the
ability to confuse opponents. Their skin is green and slimy to the
touch, but beneath it is a thick, knobby hide. Their claws are
webbed. Vodyanoi prey upon all manner of creatures but prefer
human flesh. They can rend the hulls of small vessels and fre-
quently sink or overturn small boats. Once per day a vodyanoi
can attempt to summon 1-20 electric eels with a 50% chance of
success. The existence of a saltwater variety of vodyanoi of twice
the size and greater ferocity is rumored but unconfirmed.

Unicorns dwell only in temperate woodlands, away from human
habitation. These fierce but good creatures shun contact with all
but sylvan creatures (dryads, pixies, sprites, and the like); how-
ever, they will show themselves to defend their woodland home.

Powerful steeds with gleaming coats of pure white hair, uni-
corn eyes are usually deep sea blue or fiery pink. Long, silky
white strands of hair hang down from the mane and forelock. A
single ivory-colored horn, 2 to 3 feet in length, grows from the
center of each unicorn’s forehead. Males are distinguished by the
white beard beneath the chin; females by their more elegant and
slimmer musculature. The hooves of a unicorn are cloven and
yellow-ivory in color. Unicorns speak their own language as well
as those of other sylvan creatures and elves.

Combat: Unicorns can sense an enemy from 240 yards away.
Likewise, unicorns move very silently, so opponents are penal-
ized -6 on their surprise rolls. Unicorns can kick with their front
hooves and thrust with the horn each round. Due to the horn’s
magical nature, it always has a +2 bonus to hit. Unicorns can
charge into battle, using the horn like a lance. To make this
charge, there must be at least 30 feet of open space between the
unicorn and his opponent. Opponents struck by a charging uni-
corn suffer 3-36 points of damage from impaling. Unicorns may
not attack with their front hooves in the round they charge.

Once per day a unicorn can use a teleport spell of limited range.
This spell will transport the unicorn (and its rider) to any place
that the unicorn desires, up to 360 yards away. Unicorns often use
this ability as a last resort to avoid death or capture.

In addition, unicorns can never be charmed or held by magic.
They are immune to death spells and make all saving throws
against spells as if they were wizards of 11th level. Unicorns are
immune to poison.

Habitat/Society: Unicorns mate for life and make their home in
an open dell of the forest they have chosen to protect. There, in
the boles of the trees, unicorns etch a glyph, recognizable to syl-
van creatures, indicating that the forest is under unicorn protec-
tion. Rangers have a 10% chance per level of determining
correctly whether a forest is guarded by unicorns. Once a wood-
land has a unicorn protector, no other unicorn will enter that for-
est unless the forest is very large. Each family of unicorns stakes
out a territory approximately 400 square miles (20 miles by 20
miles).

 

 

 

 

 

Travelers may pass through a unicorn’s forest freely and even
hunt there, but anyone killing for sport or damaging the forest
maliciously will be attacked if the unicorn is nearby (10%
chance). The ferocity of this attack is determined by the evil of the
trespasser. Truant youths throwing stones at animals, for exam-
ple, would be driven off with just a few bruises as a reminder,
while pillaging orcs would be hunted down and slain.

Lone unicorns occasionally allow themselves to be tamed and
ridden by a human or elf maiden of pure heart and good align-
ment. A unicorn that submits once and is treated kindly will act
as the maiden’s steed for life, even carrying her beyond the realm
of his forest if she so desires. Unicorns make exceptionally loyal
mounts and will protect their riders even unto death.

Ecology: Unicorns are herbivores, living on tender leaves and
grasses. Their only enemies are griffons and those creatures who
destroy forests, in particular red dragons and orcs.

The life span of unicorns has never been recorded but is known
to surpass 1,000 years. They are believed to maintain their youth
until death is only weeks away. The secret to this longevity is the
strong magical nature of the horn. Unicorn horns are highly
sought after, since possession of one is a sovereign remedy against
all poisons. Alternately, a single horn can be used, by an alche-
mist, to manufacture 2-12 potions of healing. Unicorn horns sell
for 1,500 gold pieces or more on the open market.

Of all the chaotic evil undead creatures that stalk the world, none
is more dreadful than the vampire. Moving silently through the
night, vampires prey upon the living without mercy or compas-
sion. Unless deep underground, they must return to the coffins in
which they pass the daylight hours, and even in the former case
they must occasionally return to such to rest, for their power is re-
newed by contact with soil from their graves.

One aspect that makes the vampire far more fearful than many
of its undead kindred is its appearance. Unlike other undead crea-
tures, the vampire can easily pass among normal men without
drawing attention to itself for, although its facial features are
sharp and feral, they do not seem inhuman. In many cases, a
vampire’s true nature is revealed only when it attacks.

There are ways in which a vampire may be detected by the
careful observer, however. Vampires cast no reflection in a glass,
cast no shadows, and move in complete silence.

Combat: When engaging in combat, vampires are savage and
fearsome opponents. They are physically very powerful, with a
Strength score of 18/76, receiving a bonus of +2 to hit and +4 to
damage. The crushing blows of a vampire’s attack are so fierce
that they inflict 5-10 points of damage.

The gaze of a vampire is one of its most powerful and danger-
ous weapons. Any person who allows the vampire to look into
his eyes will be affected as if by a charm person spell. Due to the
power of this enchantment, a -2 is applied to the victim's saving
throw versus spell. In this manner, vampires are often able to pass
posted sentries and surprise their chosen victims.

Like all undead creatures, vampires exist in both the Positive
Material and Negative Material planes at the same time. Their
powerful negative essence allows them to drain two life energy
levels from anyone they strike. If the vampire is making use of
some form of weapon in the attack, it cannot employ this power.

Weapons of less than +1 enchantment pass through vampires
without harming them in any way. Even if attacked with and
harmed by magical weapons, vampires regenerate 3 hit points per
round. If reduced to zero hit points, a vampire is not destroyed,
but is forced to assume gaseous form. Once in this state, it will at-
tempt to flee and return to its coffin where, after eight hours of
rest, it regains its corporeal form. If the defeated vampire is un-

 

 

 

 

able to reach its coffin within 12 turns, however, its essence
breaks up and the creature is truly destroyed.

Sleep, charm, and hold spells do not affect vampires. Similarly,
they are unharmed by poisons and immune to paralysis. Spells
that are based on cold or electricity cause only half damage.

At will, vampires are able to disperse their bodies into clouds of
elemental vapor and assume gaseous form. In this state, they are
all but immune to attack and can escape from almost any confine-
ment. In addition, vampires can shape change so as to take on the
form of a large bat (hence the flying movement rate given above).

Vampires can summon lesser creatures for aid. In a subterra-
nean environment, they will typically call forth a swarm of 10-
100 rats or bats. In the case of the latter, these do not physically
attack but serve to confuse and obscure the vision of the vam-
pire’s foes. In the wilderness, a vampire will normally call upon 3-
18 wolves for assistance. In all cases, the summoned animals
arrive in 2-12 rounds.

At will, a vampire can use a spider climb ability and scale sheer
surfaces. Often, they will employ this power to gain access to
rooms on upper floors without alerting those on watch down-
stairs. This power also permits the vampire to seek refuge in
places which are all but beyond the reach of mortal men.

Despite the great powers which vampires obviously possess,
they are not without weaknesses of their own. The odor of strong
garlic repels them and they will not approach it. Further, they will
recoil from the face of a mirror or lawful good holy symbol if ei-
ther of these is presented to them with courage and conviction. It
is important to understand, however, that this will not actually
harm the vampire in any way nor drive it off. Garlic will prevent
the creature from attacking or entering the area, while mirrors
and holy symbols force the vampire to find some means of re-
moving the offending object before it can be bypassed. In most
cases, the vampire will seek to overcome these hazards with the
aid of its minions. For example, a charmed person might be called
upon to attack someone who is holding the vampire at bay witha
holy symbol. Another important point to keep in mind is that a
lawful good holy symbol will affect the vampire regardless of the
vampire's original religious background. Vampires which are
splashed with a vial of holy water or struck with lawful good holy
symbols are burned by them, suffering 2-7 points of damage.
Vampire

Just as vampires can be kept at bay, so too can they be slain by
those who have the knowledge to do so. Any vampire which is
exposed to direct sunlight is instantly rendered powerless and, af-
ter one round, utterly annihilated. If the vampire can be im-
mersed in running water, it loses one-third of its hit points each
round, until destroyed on the third round. Last, a vampire can be
killed by having a wooden stake driven through its heart. In this
case, however, the creature can be restored simply by removing
the stake if further measures are not taken to ensure the fate of the
vampire. In order for it to be completely destroyed, the vampire’s
head must be cut off and its mouth stuffed with holy wafers (or
their equivalent).

In addition to its aversion to items like garlic and holy symbols,
the vampire acts under many other limitations. One of the most
powerful of these is the creature's inability to enter a home with-
out being first invited to do so by a resident of the dwelling. This
does not apply to public buildings and places of business which,
by their very nature, extend an “invitation” to all. Once a vam-
pire has been invited to enter a residence, it may come and go
freely afterward. A common manner for obtaining permission to
enter a home is the use of the vampire's gaze to charm a servant or
other inhabitant.

Any human or humanoid creature slain by the life energy drain
of a vampire is doomed to become a vampire himself. Thus, those
who would hunt these lords of the undead must be very careful
lest they find themselves condemned to a fate far worse than
death. The transformation takes place one day after the burial of
the creature. Those who are not actually buried, however, do not
become undead and it is thus traditional that the bodies of a vam-
pire's victims be burned or similarly destroyed. Once they be-
come undead, the new vampire is under the complete control of
its killer. If that vampire is destroyed, the controlled undead are
freed from its power and become self-willed creatures.

In most cases, vampires do not lose the abilities and knowledge
which they had in life when they become undead. Thus, it is pos-
sible for a vampire to have the powers of, for example, a wizard,
thief, or even priest. In all cases, of course, the new vampire be-
comes chaotic evil.

Habitat/Society: Vampires live in areas of death and desolation
where they will not be reminded of the lives they have left behind.
Ruined castles or chapels and large cemeteries are popular lairs
for them, as are sites of great tragedies or battles, Vampires often
feel a strong attachment to specific areas with some morbid sig-
nificance, like the grave of a suicide or the site of a murder.

When deciding on a course of action or planning a campaign,
vampires move very slowly and meticulously. It is not uncommon
for a vampire to undertake some scheme which may take decades
or even centuries to reach its conclusion. Because of the curse of im-
mortality that has fallen upon them, they feel that time is always on
their side and will often defeat foes who might otherwise overcome
them; the vampire can simply go into hiding for a few decades until
the passing of the years brings down its enemies.

Vampires are normally solitary creatures. When they are found
in the company of others of their kind, the group will certainly
consist of a single vampire lord and a small group of vampires
which it has created to do its bidding. In this way, the vampire can
exert its power over a greater range without running the risk of
exposing itself to attack by would-be heroes.

In general, vampires feel only contempt for the world and its
inhabitants. Denied the pleasures of a true life, they have become
dark and twisted creatures bent on revenge and terror. When a
vampire creates another of its kind, it considers the new creature
amere tool. The minion will be sent on missions which the vam-
pire feels may be too dangerous or unimportant for its personal
attention. If the need arises, these pawns will gladly be sacrificed
to protect or further the ends of their master.

Ecology: The vampire has no place in the world of living crea-
tures. It is a thing of darkness that exists only to bring about evil
and chaos. Almost without exception, the vampire is feared and
hated by those who dwell in the regions in which it chooses to
make its home. The vampire’s unnatural presence is all-pervasive
and will cause dogs and similar animals to raise a cry of alarm at
the presence of the creature.

Vampires sustain themselves by draining the life force from liv-
ing creatures. Unless they have a specific need to create additional
minions, however, they are careful to avoid killing those they at-
tack. In cases where the death of a victim is desired, the vampire
will take care to see that the body is destroyed and thus will not
rise as an undead.

Eastern Vampires:

This breed of vampire is, if anything, even more frightful than its
western cousin. Although they share many of the western vam-
pire’s strengths and weaknesses, they have the ability to fade
from sight at will. Once they have become invisible, they receive
all of the normal bonuses which such a state normally bestows,
including being attacked at -4. These monsters are unable to
charm their victims, however, and cannot assume gaseous form
at will as western vampires can.

In ages long past, the word “wight” meant simply “man.” As the
centuries have passed, though, it has come to be associated only
with those undead that typically inhabit barrow mounds and cat-
acombs.

From a distance, wights can easily be mistaken for any number
of humanoid races. Upon closer examination, however, their true
nature becomes apparent. As undead creatures, wights are night-
marish reflections of their former selves, with cruel, burning eyes
set in mummified flesh over a twisted skeleton with hands that
end in sharp claws.

Combat: Wights are fierce and deadly foes in combat. When at-
tacked, they are unharmed by any weapons that are not forged
from silver or enchanted in some manner.

The wight attacks with its jagged claws and powerful blows, in-
flicting 1-4 points of damage with each successful strike. In addi-
tion to this physical harm, the wight is able to feed on the life
essence of its foes. Each blow that the wight lands drains one level
from the victim, reducing Hit Dice, class bonuses, spell abilities,
and so forth. Thus, a 9th-level wizard struck by a wight loses 1-4
hit points and becomes an 8th-level wizard; he has the spells and hit
points of an 8th-level wizard and he fights as an 8th-level wizard.

Persons who are slain by the energy draining powers of a wight
are doomed to rise again as wights under the direct control of
their slayer. In their new form, they have all the powers and abili-
ties of a normal wight but half their Hit Dice. If the wight who
“created” them is slain, they will instantly be freed of its control
and gain a portion of its power, acquiring the normal 4+3 Hit
Dice of their kind. Once a character becomes a wight, recovery is
nearly impossible, requiring a special quest.

Wights are unaffected by sleep, charm, hold or cold-based
spells. In addition, they are not harmed by poisons or paralyza-
tion attacks.

Wights can be engaged and defeated by individuals who are
well prepared for battle with them. Physical contact with holy
water is deadly to wights and each vial splashed on one burns it
for 2-8 points of damage. In addition, a raise dead spell becomes a
powerful weapon if used against the wight. Such magic is in-
stantly fatal to the creature, utterly annihilating it.

Wights cannot tolerate bright light, including sunlight, and
avoid it at all costs. It is important to note, however, that wights
are not harmed by exposure to sunlight as vampires are.

 

 

 

 

 

Habitat/Society: Like the other undead that infest the world,
wights live in barrow mounds, catacombs, and other sepulchral
places. They despise light and places which are vibrant with liv-
ing things. As a rule, the wight is hateful and evil, seeking to sat-
isfy its hatred of life by killing all those it encounters.

Although wights are often found in small groups, they are ac-
tually solitary creatures. Without exception, encounters with
multiple wights will be a single leader and a number of lesser crea-
tures which it has created to serve it. In these cases, the leader of
the group will be more than willing to sacrifice some or all of its
minions to assure its own survival or victory.

Ecology: Like all undead, wights exist on both the Prime Mate-
rial and Negative Material planes simultaneously. It is this power-
ful link to the negative world that gives them their fearsome
level-draining ability. Further, it is this draining which provides
them with sustenance.

As they are not living creatures and have no rightful place in
our world, many animals can sense the wight's presence. Dogs
will growl or howl with alarm, horses will refuse to enter an area
which wights inhabit, and birds and insects will grow silent when
the creature passes near them. In addition, their presence will
gradually cause the plant life around their lairs to wither and die,
marking the region as unclean.

The will o'wisp is a malevolent entity that makes its home in
swamps, bogs, and moors. It subsists by luring unsuspecting
creatures to their deaths amid the natural hazards of such places
and feeding on the energies which their death struggles release.

When encountered in the wild, will o'wisps normally appear as
faintly glowing balls of light. They can alter their own color,
shape, and size to some extent and can be easily mistaken for lan-
terns, light spells, and similar sources of artificial illumination.

If they do not attack, will o’wisps are able to utterly blank out
their glows, rendering them invisible to all those who cannot spot
invisible objects, for 2-8 melee rounds.

The will o'wisp language is a most unusual one, being purely
optical in nature. All communication between will o’wisps is by
means of changes in color or brightness, many of which are far
too subtle for the average observer to notice. Because this form of
exchange is almost impossible to mimic, it is very difficult for
travelers to communicate with these creatures. Exceptional exam-
ples of this race have mastered a very simple sound-based lan-
guage. They produce sounds by vibrating very rapidly and thus
have a shallow and ghostly-sounding voice when they “speak.”

Combat: Asa rule, will o'wisps seek to avoid physical combat
with other creatures, preferring to lead them to their deaths in the
swamps around them instead. When pressed, however, they are
dangerous adversaries who must be attacked with the greatest
care. In combat, they glow blue, violet, or pale green.

Will o'wisps are very versatile flyers. They can hover in place
without effort, often looking like lanterns or similar beacons to
lure others toward them. When they decide to move, they can do
so with rapid bursts of speed or slow drifting movements.

Awill o'wisp’s main weapon in combat is its ability to manifest
a powerful electric charge. In melee, it swoops at its foe and at-
tempts to brush against the victim, discharging the stored energy.
A successful strike by one of these creatures will cause 2-16 points
of damage.

Those attacking a will o'wisp with any form of physical
weapon are able to inflict damage normally. Persons making use
of magical attacks, however, will find their powers almost inef-
fective against them. Asa rule, the only spells which have any ef-
fect on the will o’wisp are protection from evil, magic missile, and
maze. A will o'wisp which is reduced to 5 or fewer hit points
will attempt to escape. If it is unable to flee, the creature will sur-
render to its attackers and attempt to buy its safety by offering up

 

 

 

 

 

any treasure which it may have. It is important to note, however,
that the chaotic alignment of the will o’'wisp can make any agree-
ment with the creature uncertain.

Habitat/Society: For the most part, will o'wisps will be found
on their own. On rare occasions (10% of the time) groups of up to
three may be found near a particularly fertile hunting ground. In
the latter case, they will work together to trick victims into the
traps which they have arranged.

Ecology: Although difficult to say with certainty, evidence indi-
cates that the will o'wisp feeds on the fury of electrical activity
given off by the brains of panic stricken individuals as they realize
that death is inescapable. In order to prolong the suffering of their
victims and increase the amount of “food” which they give off,
will o'wisps will typically lure their victims into areas like quick-
sand pits which promise a slow and frightening death.

It seems certain that the unusual environment found in bogs
and swamps is important to the creature's existence in some way,
but the exact nature of this link is uncertain. It seems probable
that the ominous and haunting nature of these places increases
the fear and dread which their victims feel, and thus the energy
which they give off prior to death.

Wolves are active and cunning carnivores, capable of surviving in
nearly every climate known.

Although the color of their fur varies from species to species based
on the climate in which they dwell, all wolves have some features in
common. They are all characterized by powerful jaws and teeth,
bushy tails, and round pupils. In many respects, wolves greatly re-
semble domesticated dogs.

Combat: Wolves frequently hunt in packs during the winter
months, although they may be found alone when prey is more abun-
dant. When they do work in packs, they are 75% likely to follow and
attack potential prey. Such attacks are often launched at an un-
guarded moment or when the prey is distracted in some way.

The howling of wolves, by which they mark their territory and
communicate with each other, is 50% likely to panic herbivores that
are not being held and calmed. Domesticated animals, such as horses

or cattle, can usually be soothed by humans who are with them.

Habitat/Society: Wolves are social creatures, living and hunting in
packs. The social order within the pack is quite strict, with every wolf
knowing its place. Each and every wolf pack is led by a single male.

In the lair of a pack of wolves, there is a 30% chance that any given
pair of wolves will have 1-4 cubs. Although the cubs will not fight at
this point, they can be trained to serve as excellent war beasts or hunt-
ing animals.

Ecology: Wolves are valuable hunters in the wilderness. Over the
centuries, they have been hunted to extinction in several areas and the
result is normally a vast increase in the numbers of rodents and other
small animals which are normally kept in check by the hunting of
wolf packs.

In many arctic regions, mankind has used wolves as breeding stock
for sledge teams. By crossbreeding the wild canines with their domes-
ticated counterparts, men increase the overall vigor of their dogs.

Dire Wolves

The dire wolf is simply an ancestor of the various modern species. Gener-
ally large in size, they are otherwise similar to their descendants.

Worgs

Worgs are an offshoot of dire wolf stock that have attained a degree
of intelligence and a tendency toward evil. Worgs have a primitive
language and are often found serving as mounts for goblins. Worgs
are as large as ponies.

Winter Wolves

By far the most dangerous member of the species, the winter wolf is
known for its great size and foul disposition. Living only in chill re-
gions, they are able to unleash a stream of frost from their lungs once
every 10 rounds, causing 6-24 points of damage to any target within
10 feet. A save versus dragon breath is allowed for half damage.
Cold-based attacks do not harm them in any way, but fire- based ones
cause an additional +1 point per die of damage.

Winter wolves are far more intelligent than their cousins and, in ad-
dition to being able to communicate freely with worgs, have a fairly
sophisticated language of their own.

Winter wolves are quite beautiful, with glistening white or silver
fur and eyes of pale blue or silver. If in good condition, their pelts are
worth fully 5,000 gold pieces.

The wolfwere is an evil and hateful creature that delights in the
brutal slaying of humans and demihumans alike. In many cases,
the wolfwere is able to attack its victims with utter surprise be-
cause of its ability to assume the shape of a human of exceptional
charisma.

The wolfwere is able to assume a wide variety of shapes at will.
Transformation from one form to another takes only a single
round, Its true shape, and that in which it prefers to spend the
vast majority of its time, is that of a large wolf. When in this state,
it is almost indistinguishable from a dire wolf.

When a wolfwere is attempting to lure humans or demihumans
into an ambush, it will assume the shape of member of their race.
Almost without exception, the new persona will not be of the
same sex as the potential victim. Thus, a wolfwere which is stalk-
ing a male elf will transform itself into a female elf. In all cases,
the newly disguised wolfwere will have exceptional physical
beauty.

Combat: The wolfwere is a sly and dangerous adversary. In ad-
dition to its great fury and fighting prowess, its high intelligence
must not be overlooked or underestimated.

When a wolfwere first spots unsuspecting humans or demihu-
mans in its territory, it will change into its fully humanoid form
and assume the guise of a pilgrim, minstrel, or similar wanderer.
The wolfwere will normally carry some form of stringed instru-
ment which it seems to absent-mindedly play at while it travels.
The true nature of its song, however, is terrible and often fatal.
Anyone who hears the wolfwere's song and then fails a saving
throw versus spell will be overcome with lethargy. The effects of
this enchantment are the same as those of the slow spell. Once this
effect begins, it cannot be countered and lasts for 5-8 rounds.

When a wolfwere is ready to attack, the creature again changes
its shape. Now, in a form which is half-wolf and half-human (or
demihuman), it strikes. The wolfwere will almost always change
into this form when it engages in combat because it has the ability
to bite like a wolf and also wield a weapon of some type.

Inany form but its fully humanoid one, the creature can deliver
a savage bite with its powerful jaws. It is this mode of attack
which the monster prefers to employ above all others.

When in its humanoid or half-humanoid state, it is also able to
carry and employ weapons. Although the exact type of weapon
used will depend upon the specific tastes of the creature encoun-

 

 

 

 

 

tered, wolfweres tend toward axes, swords, and similar cutting
edges.

If the creature is forced to engage in battle while in its human-
oid form, it will be forced to rely wholly on its weapons for de-
fense. In such cases, it normally seeks to escape and transform
into its half-humanoid state before returning to battle.

The magical nature of the wolfwere makes it immune to dam-
age inflicted by any weapon which is not made from cold
wrought iron or enchanted to +1 or better. All other weapons are
simply turned aside by the creature's hide.

It is possible to protect oneself from attacks by wolfweres,
however, for they are disgusted by wolfsbane and will avoid it
whenever possible.

Habitat/Society: The wolfwere is generally fairly solitary in na-
ture. When encountered in the wild, it is rare that more than three
of these creatures will be found. In almost all cases, encounters
with more than one wolfwere will be with a mated pair or a group
which has decided to work together to increase the success of
their hunting.

Ecology: There is a 75% chance that any encountered wolfwere
will be running with a pack of wild wolves. In such cases, the ani-
mals will be worgs 70% of the time. If they are not worgs, they
will be common wolves. In all cases, the influence of the wolfwere
will make the creatures far more vicious and evil than they might
normally be.

Despite their fondness for wolves and worgs, wolfweres loathe
the company of werewolves. The enmity between these two mon-
sters is so great that they will often attack each other on sight.

The wraith is an evil undead spirit of a powerful human that seeks
to absorb human life energy.

These horrible creatures are usually seen as black, vaguely
man-shaped clouds. They have no true substance, but tend to
shape themselves with two upper limbs, a torso, and a head with
two glowing red eyes. This shape is a convenience born from the
habit of once having a human body.

Combat: The touch of a wraith does damage in two ways. First,
the chilling effect of the touch inflicts 1-6 points of damage, even
to creatures immune to cold. Second, such a hit drains a level of
experience from its victim. This includes hit points and all abili-
ties associated with that level, such as spell casting or combat
ability. The damage from the chill can be healed normally, but the
experience points are gone forever and must be earned again or
magically restored.

Wraiths are immune to normal weapons. An attack with such a
weapon merely passes through its body with no effect. Silver
weapons cause only half normal damage. Magical weapons in-
flict their full damage, causing a black vapor to boil away from
the body of the wraith. A wraith slowly regains its full hit points
if left alone for at least a week (recovering one point every eight
hours). Like most undead, wraiths are immune to sleep, charm,
hold, death and cold-based spells. They are immune to poison
and paralyzation. A vial of holy water causes 2-8 points of dam-
age (as acid) upon striking the body of a wraith. A raise dead spell
will utterly destroy one if a saving throw versus spell is failed.

Wraiths attack humans or demihumans in preference to other
creatures. However, animals will sense their presence within 30
feet and refuse to advance further, panicking if forced. A pack of
wraiths will try to get surprise when attacking, and will wait and
position themselves for the most advantageous moment to at-
tack. Wraiths are very intelligent and tend to cluster around the
weaker members, or stragglers, when attacking. Any human
killed by a wraith becomes a half-strength wraith under its con-
trol (e.g., a 10th-level fighter will become a 5 Hit Die wraith un-
der the control of the wraith that slew him).

This foul creature has no power in direct sunlight and will flee
from it. Sunlight cannot destroy the wraith, but the undead crea-
ture cannot attack in sunlight. It shuns bright (e.g., continual)
light sources in general, but will occasionally attack if the com-
pulsion to do so is strong.

 

 

 

 

 

Habitat/Society: A wraith is an undead spirit of a powerful, evil
human. As such, it is usually found in tombs or places where such
men and women would have died. Since such men and women
are frequently buried together, in the case of the wealthy, or with
their families, wraiths are most commonly encountered in packs.
Those that died or were buried alone might still be encountered in
packs, because a human who dies from the touch of a wraith be-
comes a wraith under the sway of its slayer. The treasure of the
wraith is usually its possessions in life, now buried with it, or
those of its victims. Wraiths exist only to perpetuate evil by ab-
sorbing the life force of as many people as possible. A character
who becomes a wraith is nearly impossible to recover, requiring a
special quest.

The wraith cannot communicate, except through a speak with
dead spell. They do not even seem to communicate with each
other, except as master to slave for combat strategy. Any attempt
to speak to a wraith is met with scorn, unless by a very powerful
party. In that case, the wraith desires only to flee. Wraiths can be
dominated by powerful evil creatures, particularly other undead,
priests, and wizards, and made to serve their will.

Ecology: The wraith has no proper niche, serving no useful pur-
pose in nature and providing no byproducts that others can use.
It requires no nourishment, killing only for the sheer hatred of
life. All creatures close to nature will shun the presence of a
wraith, It exists more in the Negative Material plane than in the
Prime Material plane, and thus is not a natural part of this world.

A distant cousin to the dragon, the wyvern is a huge flying lizard
with a poisonous stinger in its tail.

The 35-foot-long dark brown to gray body of the wyvern is
half tail. Its leathery batlike wings are over 50 feet from tip to tip.
The head alone is 4 feet long and filled with long, sharp teeth. Un-
like the dragon, it has only hind legs, using them the same way a
‘hunting bird would. The tip of the tail is a thick knot of cartilage
from which a 2- foot-long stinger protrudes, very much like that
of a scorpion. The eyes are red or orange. A wyvern does not
have a strong odor, although its lair might smell of a recent kill.
These beasts can make two sounds: a loud hiss, which sounds like
a hot sword plunged into water, and a low, deep-throated growl,
much like that of a bull crocodile.

Combat: Rather stupid, but aggressive, wyverns will nearly al-
ways attack. In combat, the wyvern always prefers to be flying,
and will seize any opportunity to take flight and continue com-
bat. If trapped on the ground it will bite (2-16 points of damage)
and use its stinger (1-6 points of damage), attacking the most con-
venient target or targets. The tail is very mobile, easily striking
over the back of the wyvern to hit an opponent to its front. The
stinger injects poison (type F) into the wound, against which the
victim must make a save versus poison or die. Even if the saving
throw is successful, the victim suffers 1-6 points of physical dam-
age from the sting.

From the air the wyvern is a far more deadly opponent. It dives
upon ground targets, attempting to snatch them up in its two tal-
oned claws (1-6 points of damage each) and fly off. Man-sized
victims are snatched if at least one talon hits for damage. Large
victims require both talons to hit in order to snatch them up. The
wyvern cannot fly while carrying anything bigger. After a dive, it
takes the wyvern a full round to circle around. On the next round
it can dive again. Once airborne with prey in its talons, the
wyvern stings and bites each round, both at +4 to hit, until the
victim is motionless. In aerial combat, the wyvern will make a
pass during which it will either bite or sting. Then it will land and
feast, not hunting again until the next day.

As a hunter, the wyvern is cunning. It will avoid letting its
shadow fall across its prey as a warning. The final approach of
the dive is done in complete silence, imposing a -2 surprise modi-
fier on the target. It trails its prey from downwind whenever pos-
sible. A mature wyvern often waits for the right moment to

 

 

 

 

strike, and is willing to let prey go that is too powerful or within
easy reach of cover. Such a wyvern understands that men, partic-
ularly those armed in bright metal, are stronger than their size
would indicate. Given a perfect opportunity, it will attempt to
snatch up an unarmored member and fly out of range.

Habitat/Society: The wyvern isa solitary creature, nesting only
with its mate and young. It tends to lair on mountainsides that
overlook forests, jungles, or sometimes plains. A wyvern makes
its lair in large caverns that can be found in such places, staking
out a territory about 25 miles across. If game is sparse, it will hunt
with a small group of its own kind. Only young wyverns attack
others of their kind, usually to establish new territory. Older
wyverns settle disputes in an unknown manner without actual
combat.

Some wyverns have been known to work with evil dragons.
Usually these dragons completely dominate the weaker and
smaller wyverns.

Ecology: An adult wyvern consumes the equivalent of a man-
sized to large creature once per day. This could translate to a
horse, pig, or a handful of sheep. While it eats them whole, the
bones are not digested, and neither are metal objects. The wyvern
eats carrion only if desperate.

The wyvern has no natural enemies, although it would not be a
match for certain powerful creatures. It is noted for the foul taste
of its flesh. No one has found a way to cure its hide and the bones
are light and brittle to aid in flying. Certain body parts are used
by spell casters as spell components, for which they will pay a
reasonable price.

Sometimes confused with the abominable snowman, the yeti is a
distant cousin to the great carnivorous apes of warmer climates.

An adult yeti stands 8 feet tall and is covered in long, white fur.
Their feet and hands are wide and flat, which helps to disperse
their great weight (about 300 pounds) on treacherous snow fields.
They travel on all fours like the apes, but fight very comfortably
standing erect. Unlike most apes and gorillas, the yeti does not
have an opposable toe on its feet. They wear no clothing or orna-
mentation. The spoor, or smell, of a yeti is very subtle in cold cli-
mates, but in confined or warm areas, they have a strong, musky
odor. The eyes of a yeti are icy blue or almost colorless. Their
claws and flesh are ivory white. Unlike many arctic creatures, the
yeti does not have a thick layer of body fat to keep it warm. In-
stead, it relies upon the special properties of its thick, warm fur. It
has a transparent second eyelid, which allows the creature to see
in blowing snow, and prevents its eyes from freezing in extreme
temperatures.

Combat: The yeti is a fierce hunter of the polar regions. It stalks
its prey and lays an ambush, attempting to gain surprise. A favor-
ite trick is to get ahead of its prey and lie in a depression in the
snow, or dig a shallow pit and cover itself with snow. Such works
can be detected only by natives of the arctic regions, and then
only 25% of the time. Against the snow, the yeti is invisible due
to its coloration until its prey is 10 yards away. Under a thin layer
of snow it is completely invisible.

Any opponent surprised by a yeti must save versus paralyza-
tion or go rigid with fright for three rounds, indicating that he has
looked into the icy blue depths of the yeti’s eyes. Any opponent
that is paralyzed in this way can be automatically hit by both
claws and squeezed.

Although the yeti does have fangs (1-4 points of damage), it
does not usually attack with them, preferring to use its formida-
ble claws. If any hit with claws is made with a natural 20, the vic-
tim is pulled in for a chilling squeeze. The creature's fur actually
absorbs heat, making it extraordinarily cold if contacted (2-16
points of damage if squeezed). The heat-absorbing property of
the yeti’s fur can work against it; damage from heat is 50%
greater than normal.

Habitat/Society: Although the yeti is of average intelligence, it
has no civilization. They can use simple tools, including man-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made weapons, but will not make any themselves. Yeti live in ice
caves in hills and mountains. Sometimes these are natural, some-
times they are excavated by the yeti or enlarged to accommodate
the family. Most yeti treasure consists of items recovered from the
bodies of explorers.

Life is harsh in the arctic, and friends and food are hard to find,
making survival and reproduction the yeti’s only goals. The yeti
will associate only with its immediate family, the young leaving
to fend for themselves as soon as they mature. A family usually
consists of an adult male with one to three females and a 50%
chance of 1-6 young if females are present. In an attacking group,
the largest yeti is the male, the next largest ones are his mates.
Any others are small males or females that are due to leave the
family soon.

Ecology: Any living creature not of its family is considered po-
tential food, including other yeti. This does not make them fool-
hardy; only a starving yeti will attack an obviously stronger
party. Their typical diet consists of herd creatures, such as cari-
bou, bears, wolves, and other creatures inhabiting the snowy
mountains in which they live. The yeti may turn to scavenging in
hard times. They range across a wide area in search of food, usu-
ally 15 miles in all directions from their lair.

Yeti claws and teeth have value only because of the rarity of the
creature. They sell for about a gold piece a tooth or claw on the
open market. Yeti fur is another story. It is prized by those living
in cold climates for its extraordinary ability to keep its wearer
warm. A full grown yeti pelt can fetch up to 300 gold pieces on the
open market.

Descendants of humans whose blood has been fouled, yuan-ti
have varying degrees of snakelike body parts. They are highly in-
telligent and evil, always plotting to advance their causes.
There are three major varieties of yuan-ti: purebloods,
halfbreeds, and abominations. A pureblood can pass for human
80% of the time. It has only slight differences from true humans,
such as slit eyes, or a forked tongue, maybe even small fangs.
Halfbreeds are part human and part snake. Roll a d6 twice on the
table below; a duplicate roll produces no result, but is not re-
rolled. Ignore unworkable combinations. This is a general guide;
the DM can invent his own combinations of snake and human.

Abominations are either all snake (50%) or have only a single hu-
man feature, either head or arms, and are of large size (10 feet
long). Halfbreeds and abominations disdain wearing human
clothing or armor, while purebloods do not. All yuan-ti use
weapons and other items. Yuan-ti do not give off an odor that hu-
mans can detect. However, animals will detect a dry, musty smell
on them. The snake features of these foul creatures vary greatly
from simple green and brown scales to wild patterns of stripes, di-
amonds, and whorls in reds and blues. Yuan-ti speak their own
language. They can also speak with any snake or snakelike crea-
ture. Those with human heads speak common besides.

Combat: Yuan-ti are geniuses, and fight as such. They plan
elaborate traps and utilize their surroundings superbly in combat.
They prefer ambushes to direct confrontation. In a mixed group,
the least valuable and powerful attack the opponent first. This
means that the purebloods go before the half-breeds, which go

   

 

 

 

 

before the abominations. The group leader may order particular
members forward before others if it provides for a better strategy.
When encountered outside their temple area, only one to four of
them are in a group. In the temple area they can be found in much
larger groups.

Purebloods have 6 Hit Dice, half-breeds have 7 or 8 Hit Dice,
and abominations have 9 Hit Dice. All yuan-ti, if they have
hands, always use weapons, preferring those with an edge. They
use poison, particularly slow acting types, but in traps, not on
weapons.

Any yuan-ti with a human head can cast the following spells
once per day; cause fear, darkness (15 foot radius), snake charm,
sticks to snakes, neutralize poison, suggestion, and polymorph
other.

Habitat/Society: Yuan-ti are devout worshippers of evil. They
also hold all reptiles in high esteem. The center of yuan-ti life is
the temple. They tend toward old ruins far away from man, but
have even been known to build underneath human cities. Their
own works tend toward circles, with ramps and poles replacing
stairs. In all cases they are secretive about the location of their
city or temple. The abominations rule over the yuan-ti, and are
the leaders of the temple, with the high priest (human headed) rul-
ing over all. Their rituals often involve bloody sacrifices. The
purebloods take care of all outside negotiations, always pretend-
ing to be human. Yuan-ti speak their own language and common,

Ecology: Ages ago, a cult of humans worshiping a reptilian el-
der god recieved a “blessing” from their dark lord: their offspring
all were part snake. Since then the breeding line has been polluted
and mixed, producing purebloods (those least favored), half-
breeds, and abominations (the truly blessed). They are strictly
carnivorous, eating any warm-blooded creature they can catch.
They have a special taste for birds and human flesh. They are
clever enough about their ecology not to overhunt any particular
region. Larger groups keep captive herds of wingless birds or
other warm-blooded creatures.

Zombies are mindless, animated corpses controlled by their crea-
tor, usually an evil wizard or priest.

The condition of the corpse is not changed by the animating
spell. If a body was missing a limb, so would be the zombie cre-
ated from it. Since it is difficult to get fresh bodies, most zombies
are in sorry shape, usually missing hair and flesh, and sometimes
even bones. This affects their movement, making it jerky and un-
even, Usually zombies wear the clothing they died (or were bur-
ied) in. The rotting stench from a zombie might be noticeable up
to 100 feet away, depending upon the condition of the body. Zom-
bies cannot talk, being mindless, but have been known to utter a
low moan when unable to complete an assigned task.

Combat: Zombies move very slowly, so they strike last in any
combat round. All zombies are given simple (single-phrase) or-
ders which they can follow. They always fight until called off or

destroyed, and nothing short of a priest can turn them back. They
always move in a straight line toward their opponents, with arms
outstretched, seeking to claw or pummel their victims to death.
Like most undead, zombies are immune to sleep, charm, hold,
death magic, poisons, and cold-based spells. A vial of holy water
inflicts 2-8 points of damage (as acid) upon striking.

Habitat/Society: Zombies are typically found near graveyards,
dungeons, and similar charnel places. Zombies follow the spoken
commands of their creator—as spoken on the spot or given
previously—of limited length and complication (a dozen words
or so). The dead body of any humanoid creature can be made into
a zombie.

Ecology: Zombies are not natural creations and have no role in
ecology or nature.

Ju-Ju Zombies

These foul creatures are made when a wizard drains the life force
from a man-sized humanoid creature with an energy drain spell.
Their skin is hard, gray, and leathery. Ju- ju zombies have a spark
of intelligence. A hateful light burns in their eyes, as they realize
their condition and wish to destroy living things. They can under-
stand a full-sentence instruction with conditions, and use simple
tactics and strategies. Since they become zombies at the moment
of death, their bodies tend to be less rotted and in better condi-
tion. Ju-ju zombies do not have to attack last in a combat round,
and use normal rules to determine when they strike. They are
dextrous enough to use normal weapons, although they must be
specifically commanded to do so. These zombies can hurl weap-
ons such as javelins or spears, and can even fire bows and cross-
bows. Their Dexterity is such that they can climb walls as a thief
(92%) and they strike as a 6 Hit Dice monster.

The animating force of a ju-ju zombie is more strongly tied to
the Negative Material plane. The result is that only +1 or better
magical weapons can harm them. Regardless of the magic on the
weapon, only edged or cleaving weapons inflict normal damage,
while blunt and piercing weapons cause only half damage. In ad-
dition to normal spell immunities, ju-ju zombies are immune to
all mind affecting spells, including illusions. Their bodies have
normal zombie immunities as well as immunity to electricity and
magic missiles, and fire causes only half damage. Ju-ju zombies
are turned as spectres.
